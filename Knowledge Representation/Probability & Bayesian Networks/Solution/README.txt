To make both the .py and .ipynb file work you need only put them into the AIMA
repo folder to access probability.py, or copy probability.py into the same folder
as both the .py and .ipynb files.  The probability.py file is the only dependency.

The final part of the assignment explaining inference by enumeration is in the
.ipynb file at the end.

These files were built using Python 3.7 & Jupyter Notebook, there are no
anticipated scenarios where running either will fail due to dependencies if both
Python and Jupyter are up-to-date.
