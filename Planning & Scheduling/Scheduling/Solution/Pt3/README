The solution for Part 3 reads from the file 'pt3_meetings.csv', to change
the path edit the variable meetings_file_name on line 124.

The .csv file takes the format:
Line 1: Meetings, 1, 2, ..., n
Line 2: Lecturer Name (str), meeting_1_sch (bool), meeting_2_sch (bool), meeting_n_sch (bool)
Line ...
Line j: Lecturer Name (str), meeting_1_sch (bool), meeting_2_sch (bool), meeting_n_sch (bool)
To run the file:

$ python3 Pt3_Timetabling.py
