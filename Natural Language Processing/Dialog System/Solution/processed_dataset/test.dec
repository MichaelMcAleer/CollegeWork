did you want more of the original cast
do you think she will turn to the dark force
i'm still excited though
i am convinced they are brother and sister
why do you say that
but how many exactly
get out really
a manichean balance is tempting because it feels intuitively right you don't have to delve into the buddhist philosophy that lucas was getting into
yes there is the werewolf in the space port scene and so many other things
don't worry i also really like chewbacca and r2d2
i like the fact that they're releasing a movie every year and i can't wait to see the new one in december
that no that never happen not really he wanted to save vader more than kill
obi-wan scares off the sand people with a higher pitched voice in 2011
in the new hope the attack on the empire's death star was very exciting
yes that was gruesome
i love the new ones the best i'd say the force awakens
yeah she found out she had jedi powers in the first movie
okay lets make this interesting
it was hayden christensen i thought he was okay i agree slightly stiff performance
me too i can't wait for episode 8
who was your favorite character from the first set of movies
and the second
what happens in battlefront
yeah i'm surprised they didn't use it more often
i am not even sure if that is there face or a mask
i love yoda so quote worthy but i have to go with han solo
it was hard to watch but so worth it
they're stupid what their union or guild or whatever need to negotiate a mandatory percent profit sharing with the movie makers
yeah i liked that one did you
wait what you didn't like the other star wars movies
ha darth vader nubian god
i agree i hated the actor that played the young anakin skywalker
absolutely i loved the banter between him and the human characters
i also like the original trilogy more
i can't believe they even released the prequel in the first place
oh it was yoda didn't have any choice though there was a good chance that luke would have fallen but he was their only hope
i still think vader rules all would be neat to see a vader versus maul then winner versus the emperor fight scene
perfect for the part of propincess leia
well for starters in that universe luke and leia aren't related and would probably have wound up together
yeah peter cushing was awesome as tarkin and i've always thought it was neat that both he and christopher lee were involved in star wars given their past history together
they had 4 engines also
well at the time in '70s it was just impractical to do that but by the 2000s technology advanced and he had a bigger budget so his idea of a clone army came to fruition
i agree it was my favorite hands down
i was sorry to see han solo killed off and by his son no less
yeah when obi wan was a beginner old obi wan would have stomped him in seconds
i believe it said december
they were kind of like soldiers
can't blame a guy for doing that
it really feels like the end of an era but that makes me excited for the beginning of a new one
it's pretty awesome i hope they will expand a bit on this story line as he is one of the most iconic characters from the old movies
oh yes i thought she did a great job
oh yeah
he was smuggling literal monsters rathtars across the galaxy it makes me think that kanjiklub is an organization of black market monster dealers
i heard a theory that it could be mace windu
it's not unlike some of the leaders in the world today
of course i'll bet you're more of a luke kinda fellow
i don't know i think the sacrifice was more powerful this way and leia didn't die
alright how about in a straight up fist fight
i liked jar jar
yes i love star wars
i heard a quote from the director that said he isn't any sort of sith or character we've seen before
but i thought it was as big as a planet
i don't know if it's canon anymore or not but they thought it was a little weird and figured he was the sith lord behind the war
a light saber
i believe that voice is spoken by james earl jones do you know him
the part that i am most excited is about mark hamill
sure - he was frozen and he had that grimace on his face
me too
i liked most of them but at the moment star wars the force awakens is my favorite
that sounds good
his story was sad
and that's fine i would also take a general grievous or count dooku film maybe showing what they were up to before episode ii
yes but he's young he still has time to be redeemed sooner rather than later
they were like swords
jabba the hut was really ugly
yo
i am watching that cartoon based on starwars movies
but that's because she didn't need to
oh good question let me think
wait so the order of star wars goes 45612 and 3
no he was in it though
shes so pretty
yea i liked that too
i hated that they killed maul off though
i do imagine a kid around 10 their imagination is at it's peak anything is possible at that age
sure but in yoda vader the emperor han luke chewie leia r2d2 c-3p0 and even characters like tarkin that's just the original trilogy
yeah that was amazing as were the effects as always but those ewoks man
are they that good
it is not that bad i like it
general hux
who is your favorite villain
he's whiney and he runs and he's responsible for billions of deaths
i say we rent the star wars new hope trilogy and splurge on those movies make it a whole day too because i can never get enough of looking at luke skywalker what do you think about that
me too but i'm only into the first three
i guess that kind of makes sense but you'd think old ben could have accomplished a lot more while alive
you wont be disappointed
gonna have to say solo
it is a great movie
well luke had one in the beginning of epsiode 6
i agree with you there and what do you think at the end of the day makes star wars so special
i would probably say the first prequel
yeah i think i remember reading how she finished all her parts before she died
yeah that was confusing
my other favorite part about the empire strikes back was the saber fight between luke and darth vader that was awesome
did you see the force awakens yet
not originally but in the updated one yes
yeah he's not a puppet in part 1 but he is in part 3
that creature had a head that wrapped around his neck
in a way it definitely felt like a do-or-die situation
i an hardly wait i think its the last jedi right the last one with carrie fisher may she rest in peace
maybe she learns
he was only there for comic relief and even then he was horrible
and jar jar binksi mean come on seriously
no i wasn't even born yet
the obvious choice is luke skywalker but darth vader would come a close second
i bet that was fun
but he also tortures the imperial pilot guy so there's that
who you think snoke is
i just bought it on dvd and can't wait to see it
i was surprised that the child of han and leia turned out dark in the first place though
you can get them on amazon
they also destroy a planet like they do in the first movie
that would be really freaky if she was kylo ren's long lost twin
the wookies helped a lot
darth vader had some kind of base there in the forest
i sure hope so he's my favourite character from the prequels
too much cgi
he has experience and wisdom compared to most of the jedi so most likely he also has more battle experience and he just stands out
mine would be the cartoon version of general grevious
yes definitely
empire strikes back
i just thought it was a little ovr the top
he's green
vader is more legendary for sure however he didn't feel as evil as darth maul to me
that's true i just wish yoda was more powerful i guess
qui-gon jinn i think
do you have a least favorite movie
what is it
he definitely brought a lot of comic relief to the movies
hello
really why not
that's a very interesting fact
i really like master yoda
does wookie sound
who is salacious crumb
yeah i wish i saw more of him the the force awakens
have you read the comics
rogue one showed how organized they had become even though there was still a senate
he directed the empire strikes back
believe it or not yes i still remember seeing it
that's true that one was good
they're alright i guess although i've only seen the force awakens and not rogue one
yea i was kind of skeptical at first but i really enjoyed his performance
how about the rest of the suit
i hated watching leia as jaba's slave that part disturbed me
i wonder how he was recruited
well billy d williams is just so cool
no dude it would have been cool it was actually james earl jones man he has the best voice
if you were a jedi what side would you be on
i like the episode when obi wan vs darth vader
of course it is everyone knows that line
harrison ford is great in the star wars movies too
what is the rancor
i like leia organa in those
i see your point that the death of family is what drive him nuts
yes that was awesome that blind guy was the best
i think it would take the death star on in a more immediate fashion
better than the new one
chewie would hurt you for even suggesting that
he and han are great together
when luke finds out that vader is his father
hahaha did it ever work
unfortunately no the force is not strong in me
hans solo was great in it
obi wan kenobi
even faster i'd be the champion
i wish he was the star of the movies
really
no but i heard they are a lot of fun
i really liked that one too it seemed closer in tone to the original movies
there weren't a lot of politics and superfluous stories like in episodes i-iii
why han solo
this year right
what's that
who
why finn isn't an evil person
that seems more like friendly smuggler business
i have to agree i have shirts actions figures and posters too
if kylo ren ends up having a sister then say hello to lord solo
tge the plots are great on all of them
cool cool
the last jedi i am so down
well luke of course but obie won
i don't know about a big fan but i have enjoyed some of the movies
oh thats so cool
i think that one is up there too in the newer movies i like the new characters
yeah i never bothered checking out any of those ewok spinoff movies i had enough of them the first time
yeah that's what i think
well they update it when new installments come out
he is a great actor
i guess he had that though he did plenty of good too
i really liked return of the jedi
why
yes good memory
oh come on i agree it was the weakest but awful
yeah like seeing the start of darth vader as an innocent kid
you like star wars
yes i have have you
well half skywalker anyway
me too
there really is
defintly the best of the prequels and a very good movie
i like the old ones and i like the new ones but i didn't really like the three in the middle
i reallupy liked the empire strikes back
i sold some vintage space craft on ebay i think it was called the millenium falcon
yeah but it still reminds me of a sword
that still doesn't explain why he didn't get a medal in a new hope
i would have to go with green
oh god i'm going to kill you then i'm going unfriend you on facebook stop following you on twitter
the galaxy is a massive place maybe she just has the force
i love the return of the jedi the ewoks love them
i hope this wraps up some storylines though
nope not one bit
yes but i figured harrison ford wouldn't do many more sequels
yeah i thought that too a little bit but i liked how they added so much more diversity to the cast
huh what are you talking about
no
yeah it's definitely a rough crowd in there
i think he gets bonked in the back of the head by accident like one of the three stooges and knocked into the sarlacc pit
well some die hards would say start with episode 4 and watch them in linear sequence
i guess the force would have to be with you
well now i think they absolutely have to make it what if liam neeson came back as the ghost of qui-gon
yeah i was still sad
yeah it was interesting
huh
which one was that
i suppose you're right
that's not very befitting of a major villain
that has to be darth vader
i doubt it
yeah i guess considering people are even sleeping with aliens
it really is a great part of the original series
alden ehrenreich
i still think it's really irresponsible of him he should have warned all those people they all died because he didn't see these things coming
look i'm just saying it's very convenient that a guy who can see the future can't see anything about these cataclysmic events that end up changing and entire galaxy
are they friendly
the psychological examination luke goes through - from yoda but also from his own perspective - was very intriguing
han solo doesn't evolve that much in empire - his big evolution came in star wars when he came down on the side of the rebels
but leia this totally moral upstanding princess and stateswoman has a lot of self-learning to do when she falls for han
that makes sense now i love empire strikes back even more
like what
we can only hope someone gave it to him later
yeah i know what you mean i liked rey a lot though
i love how it establishes the universe and sets the tone for everything to come
i bet he spent time standing by the shore seeing how far he could skip rocks with his mind
darth vader might be done anyway
well technically he wasn't darth vader then he was still anakin skywalker he didn't become darth vader until near the end of revenge of the sith
very cool right and low-key at the same time
rushed how
in the timeline
i'm predicting luke dies in this next movie
really i get that they're young but why r2
she chokes jabba the hutt to death definitely a strong heroine
i would have to say the special effects
what did you think about the han and leia romance
what an amazing voice he has
of whom i don't care about and half of whom i still don't remember the names
i don't know about that i think he turned to the dark side in force awakens and he killed his father han solo i don't think you can go back after that
who were some of the actors under consideration
who's the bad guy who killed han
the empire strikes back was awesome including the soundtrack i can still hum the imperial march
nah he does not seem the type
maybe it will show him and jabba the hut
i love it though it is a little extreme
i wasn't too happy with the next three they tried to do
i think he's in all of them the first one for sure
me too john williams is one of my favorite movie composers
i got the complete soundtracks when they came out and i listen to them often
ezra isn't he pre-episode 4 and a good jedi in training
you mean the struggle between right and wrong
crazy weapon almost unstoppable
yes i did it was great
well in episode one anikin's metachlorins levels were off the chart so is accessing the force a biologicial thing
i guess i do agree with that point
i really liked princess leia she's really brave
i think he is really fluffy i'd love to touch his fur
like i said i always thought he looked and sounded cool
right but then she got better towards the end
i guess that'd be pretty lucrative on a desert planet
huh
bear with me though so the midichlorians produce an energy that's present in everyone but jedi are busting with the things
i was surprised that the original senator turned into the emperor
yeah their is 8 including rogue one
yes the storm troopers have all kinds of different weapons and obvious ranks it makes the fight scenes that much more intriguing
true the base of starkiller is mostly a fighter battle with ren and rey's saber duel inbetween
i don't know - i hope so - maybe as a force ghost
unh hunh what do you like about it
don't you also have a star wars key chain
yes i do it's a star wars episode 1 key chain that my parents got me way back when episode 1 came out
i don't think i have
he's classic
absolutely and with a ten million dollar budget they had to make sure it was great
do we know she will die
i'm not as interested in the mythology i just want to see people bashing each other with awesome weapons
i don't know i was expecting at least one person to live
yes have you
because he's han solo i mean he's the best one
of course i think she will do lots of good for the galaxy
yeah luke almost killed his dad
i think it's a great ending to the original star wars trilogy
well the last two films were solid so i'd say it should be as well
i thought that was gross
yeah that was it it has been so long since i have seen the movie
who is your favorite character in all of the star wars movies
i did not see that one coming at all
they've already put some fan videos on youtube
the thing everyone debates
i have watched that clip of youtube the fight scene wasn't bad but his death came out no where to me
what character was your favorite
but didn't the music change from the original version
which one
i did i really enjoyed seeing a story not focus on the jedi and instead on the more regular people it felt like a war movie
okay that's a good one my favorite part is is when r2 zapps salacious crumb
not quite sure i know he'll be in them though
i'm just sick of seeing another movie franchise being sold to the highest bidder and then being squeezed for every penny it's worth
yes that's a lot of it the rebel alliance was fairly regressive
why did he bring luke to his aunt and uncle
she ended up on the planet of alderaan
i love that last battle with obi-wan
it's a tough choice between padme and rey
she loses her home in the process of seeking justice
well star wars is too complex to be analyzed it's meant to be just enjoyed
i wonder if the soundtrack for the new films will feel like way in another ten years
i probably will keep seeing the new ones if they are as good as that one was
yes a lot of tragedies were caused by him and in the end he was redeemed
yeah it's a bit complicated but i do think it's intentional
how so did it bother you when his father died
i actually liked it
then those poor nazi in the building they shot white phosphorous in was cooking
i'm gonna have to see that
which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear
i liked when he was 1st seen by elizabeth as a boy
delta force and you
i hope he comes out with another soon
the first one was better
yes when he recited the bible verse albeit a little wrongly it was so intense
i'm afraid i don't know
to me that pretty much signaled the end of the indiana jones ever being in danger
i really like them too
i've always like the whole guy with two guns thing he does in each film
i liked that movie although i did think that ending part was a little bit cheesy you know they way ethan hunt kicks the sand and the gun flys straight up into his hand like it was just levitating or something
i want to watch that film again
the one where the dude flew through the window
i've always wanted an action movie with the most minimal amount of plot in favor of being almost nothing but action sequences
not to take anything away from him he's super good at doing action
reeves' mentor
do you like it
yeah he really needs to pick his projects a little more carefully
stallone was pretty ripped back then
the plot is pretty much the same
i cant wait
they should make one in the current day
there were a lot of good fight scenes in that movie
hey there
i thought it was pretty good
that has to be heat
that was an amazing scene with two of the best american actors going toe to toe
yeah that is correct
ha he's just so funny
yeah sure love them
kinda
it reminded me of some of the video games that become movies like max payne
did you like it
the first one did happen during an office christmas party
i think you are thinking of john wick
i'm a bit skeptical when it comes to that movie i really feel it's over hyped because it's a chick
jason stathum has got to be one of the best action movie stars today
john woo is the top director in that genre i think
personally i was on team iron man how about you
oh yeah they are both so talented
it has chris evans in it it is not a really popular one
yeah that one was great too
i remember the sequel too the cradle of life
that scene is full of amazing dialogue
the marvel one
with the travelers i think they portray them wrongly
i loved that movie tom hardy is incredible
yes i am he is great
nowadays not so much i like 80's and 90's the most
pretty forgettable he's not a very likeable hero and the action scenes were bland
it is definitely one of them
yes that was a great movie
nah it is not
it's hard to get such quality action films
i might i'm looking forward to seeing more of michael bay's work
yep a lot more was on the line since they could crash planes
that is a great film and i especially enjoyed tommy lee jones's character
he's got like 3 oscars
me too i like the terminator
same here
who is the bad guy
joanne samuel
did you like it
with cumberbatch
i wonder why
that sounds interesting what happens in it
wow that was a long time ago what did you think of it
i agree edward furlong did a great job for that being his breakout role
i might
well dom and his team go into retirement of sorts but had to be called out of it due to some unexpected villains
i think the bad guy is better that where he pretends to be a cop and kidnaps the girl is really memorable
all the movies he's done and you go to commando
mel gibson was pretty funny in it
i think so is that the one where the guy's sister gets kidnapped
i hope they come out with a part 2
is that a bad thing
me too spiderman was such a treat
et was the first movie my mother took me to after my parents got divorced
even the old guy next door was funny
you're right that wasn't very realistic who would actually sign up for something like that
yeah the world is kind of unique
yes i about died laughing
groot is pretty funny it makes me laugh every single time
maybe sunshine of a spotless mind
she's great in this film she is an excellent female lead
i know with sandra bullock i much prefer madonna in the role
i have to pick out a movie that represents or is based on a historical event and write about it what are the best movies like that you know of
the colossal titan was great when he emerged because he was steaming like he was just made
yes i'm thinking of a couple right now and just got the chills it's not as gruesome it has more build up and suspenseful scares
so it didn't flow well
oh yeah i want to see that one
will ironman be in it
oh i believe it could be possible they just have to train an insane amount
either way it was a great set of movies
i don't
yes the rediculous part is that the iocane powder actually kills the guy who pours the wine
even city of god you sure
i will definitely check them out
up to that point the movie looked so raw and brutal
ok we can agree to disagree then
oh okay i remember seeing it advertised on television now it seemed to have pretty good graphics and special effects
what did you think of it
baby face is worth seeing
why do you say that
yes but it was much more than that
still got a ways to go in some areas let's make a movie
the last movie i saw was get out and i thought it was good but not as good as everybody was saying on facebook
well i went to the movies and watched the latest pirates of the caribbean dead men tell no tales
yea the motion and actions he made were hilarious
ah yes the true bond film i liked it a lot how about you
you think a year is a long time for movie watching
yes i have
i liked the benjamin bratt cameo too
well it just came out but wonder woman
oh yeah how was that
do you think aquaman will be good
animal house with john belushi caddyshack with bill murray and chevy chase and blazing saddles with mel brooks and harvey korman
the leads were all terrific taraji p henson octavia spencer and janelle will go down as legends
oh yeah that thing with jim carrey that was weird man
don't forget the charlie's daughters' talent show routine yes i agree i'll have to see this movie again when it releases home
wait they are doing old man logan
yes but there are tons of other things going on she has a daughter who starts figuring out what's going on
that sounds like a great story about determination
i have the other two movies in the series and i cannot get enough
pfft no way
is it based on a book
good i'm glad i could help you make that decision don't forget the popcorn
i bet you mean that it's a comic book based film and you think they're childish
yes 3 pm works for me ever since the first trailer preview i was hooked
that is seriously true
that one was pretty good but i'm more of a lion king fan
it stars christian bale and hugh jackman
in a way which is no coincidence as both movies were directed by christopher nolan
i had several but there was one that his part could have been written or exactly
i was blown away
i had a packed audience that was into it
which saint it sounds like a bit of a leap
me too i really liked the other characters as well
fair enough he's top 3 for me no question
yeah i could see that
bill murray and richard dreyfus
who is in that one
no he definitely hasn't but this one was pretty awesome
yeah in the end you realize that the photos are actually all of the old caretakers of the house that have died
well do you like anything good
what was interesting about it
ok that sounds good

no worries mate expecting you
you should the score is great too
i really liked 'let me explain' because it was so funny
it just didn't work for you
i like that one but i don't think kids enjoy it as much
yeah thats why we gotta see it were fans
have you ever seen what ever happened to baby jane
what is it rated
no i haven't even heard about it
who is in the movie
definitely not
i heard it goes into wonder woman's amazon origins
so i guess we are just as bad as the people who have only seen the new ones yet claim they are better
sounds good it was great talking about star wars with you
i would like to have some minions to do my housework for me
and they all gradually intersect and are changed by a moment of total strangeness
you know i used to underestimate her acting abilities but she has been really good in the dramatic roles she's been in
i mean suicide squad was pretty good but batman v superman sucked
i know marvel did it perfect each character got a movie you got to know them and then you brought them all together
is it any good
i know well what's that new movie called
sure do you like animated movies
yeah why do i ever get a doctor like that i wouldn't mind getting a check up every now and then if the doctors acted like they were more caring
those are both excellent choices i remember some other well known people starred in inception
this might be a little strange but it love christmas movies
no look it up
does that include rocky 3
ha ha you mean like when doug says i've been doing a little figure skating
have you seen the new baywatch movie
yes it was she was a great fighter just like him
sounds fun
there was some really good tv being made but that seems to have died out too
awesome sounds like we will have to watch it
i know the relationship between the grandpa and the little brother is great
really i thought it might have been produced by universal studios or something
i saw it in theaters it was phenomenal
who are the main actors in this one
ok i would say after we eat lunch let's go to the matinee
definitely or prevent them to begin with when you put on a movie everyone can enjoy
that movie never gets old to me
okay gotcha how about some more plot details
i cannot disagree with that one bit batman has had many movies made from animation to live action what is your favorite animated batman movie
i enjoyed it quite a bit it also has elijah wood in it as well
whoppi goldburg and ray laiota
is it a drama
yeah i refuse to watch that
why not
you must be kidding right
i am also on the lookout when i see movies directed by him i always like to watch them
i love the movie it's so funny and got sweet scenes
i'm gonna bet my money it is
no not yet
isn't that what most of them do these days
are you a fan of anime
i might watch that later who does it star
who was in it
how absolutely pulp fiction
in the book forrest goes to space
my favorite tom hanks movie is castaway
there are tons of actresses that look pretty can sing and perform why take someone who only met 2 of the 3 qualifications
yeah i think i've seen all of his movies and i love them all
yesfunny and fantastic music
love stories can have sad endings though
i heard about it but i'll wait until it comes to dvd
yeah i think i remember reading his name somewhere but it didn't ring a bell
maybe that had a good bit to do with casting then
i appreciate your recommendation it sounds like a fun watch
sounds great see you then
they looked like they had such a great chemisty which i liked
that's so funny
the whole cast of characters are so sweet that you would love to live near them in this neighborhood
no it sounds like most of the mutants were killed off somehow
yes he is john wick so his wife dies suddenly and she had bought a dog that he gets after she died
it's already out
whats your favorite pixar movie then
you know amy adams did that movie with jake gyllenhaal
i really can't wait for another amy adams movie
it was a really strange and unnecessary cliffhanger
yeah then the rest of the movie could be crazy missions
i heard he killed like 80 guys in original
the one with jeff bridges and meryl streep was predictable
oh i know that movie it was hilarious
monkey see monkey do you know literally with the flying monkeys hunh
that is pretty funny or when they are driving down the wrong way just before that and john candy is making like that couple is drunk
two words kurt russell
that's part of it i've thought about going there buying a ticket sitting there watching it then going home and it's just not appealing
which did you like better the animated or live-action version
i know i think he might retire
no was it any good
he was born on the same date as my daughter different years of course
i think they are too
so coraline has recently moved from michigan to oregon
what do you mean boring
me too i thought emma watson did a great job
yes there is basically every type of genre combined into one film
that is still not a good enough answer
he had to bury his acorn for the winter
the movie wasn't a wildlife documentary
it is really a thrilling movie as well
yeah she was a stand out character and ended up being a nice person in the movie
they played the game very well
ooh heh how about that scene where egon is under her desk connecting the monitor i can see you're a very haaaandy person
i think i liked perks of being a wallflower a little bit more logan lerman emma watson and ezra miller had such great chemistry and they all had really good character backgrounds and growth throughout the movie
i personally want to watch the new despicable me movie
yeah he even delievers her baby in the midst of a shoot out but she takes a round to the head and dies
how so
i know right i had it on vhs the second it came out
i imagine its diffacult and frustrating guess thats why were are not actors or directors
you can't forget here's looking at you kid
are you kidding me
what about lord of the rings
just pick one that makes you think a lot
that's a hard one to decide he has so many good ones gone girl seven fight club
i like part iii when they travelled to the wild west
maybe a little eventually i started to go into the water
how do they go about this
yes now they begin to win races and mcqueen starts to lose confidence because he cannot be fast enough
well 20 years later kevin hart is stuck at a boring job that he hates when suddenly the rock contacts him with a new name and asks him if he wants to hang out
good movie how about the lodger
i know what you mean it's got a twist or something
there are so many good action movies i'm not sure
well he was awesome in the rundown
very true but he does it so well
yes the one with island girl who wants to sail
the original one of course natalie wood is the best
yes very good these grade school kids killed their friend and someone is getting revenge 6 years later on prom night
yes i ike her a lot
i thought he was hilarious
did you enjoy the movie would you recommend it
you've got to be kidding me it is seriously one of the funniest movies of all time it stars steve martin and bernadette peters
the mark wahlberg and john goodman movie about the boston marathon bombing
i feel like i need more info on the characters and the plot written down to be able to understand everything well
it really is and if you get a chance to watch it in 3d it's amazing
you would not do that in real life but it's was just done for the movie
that was a great movie
i think this director was really going for the tarantino vibes there's a heavy focus on the dialogue and the fun moments i did have to admit the injured crawling around got a little tedious after awhile and the space they were in felt very enclosed
not that i can recall but he has a really good voice
it's fun and then it's sad
yes there was
why those two
right and some academic philosophical questions but the illusionist is different
who is in that one
oh wow what a cast i love eddie murphy who is he in the movie
i do have you watched them
no i do not know what is playing should i
like what what movies do you research
have you heard of my neighbor totoro
okay what else i see one hear called spirited away is that good
have you read the book ready player one that's being turned into a movie as well it's coming out in march
i do not go to the theaters very often but i made sure to watch that one in the theater
i wonder who would win in a fight
yeah everyone was getting decapitated
yeah just gory and overkill
i will
so are you saying he was the good guy in the story
towards the end of the story when andrew is finishing his improvisational drum solo you can see fletcher smile
obviously he can't tell his jokes
that's true i think they even call it out in the movie
i like the fact that he can only get to people once they fall asleep in their dreams
what is your favirote film of his
well i do think it's pretty cool that they have digitally processed it to look good even today
yeah it was so fast paced it moved at breakneck speed
the ending was so awesome but kind of sad
that is the sad part they treated him like dirt and basically almost killed him
have you seen the new pirates of the caribbean
i can't wait to see it but i like to wait until it's been there for weeks to see a movie that way i almost have the theater to myself
what did you think of the ending
definitely i wanted to see more of her after batman vs superman and i still want to see her in another solo wonder woman movie
yeah i go let's do it then we can watch all the president's men too
hard to find time to go to the movies for me
ohh i have to see it then where does the movie take place
well i guess he did lose the weight but there is controversy about the movie
pretty much
i remember that they feared it could bomb at the box office
allison williams played her character so perfectly it was scary
that sounds silly but also in a scary kind of a way i can now see why this considered a dark comedy
i haven't really looked what good ones are coming out
are you kidding me
classic star wars trilogy - episodes 4-6 all the way
gal gadot and chris pine
we just need more good ones
i like smart movies
i liked the original ones
and leave sam behind
yes everyone is so good the performances are top notch
not that many
who was in it
why do you like documentaries
did you really like that one
milk
well they seem to like it
first there was the scarecrow without a brain
yeah i like seth rogan so basically anything he is in i'll watch
one of the most well known lines
that's disappointing
it came out in 2005 and was made on a small budget but looks amazing despite that it did get a super small theatrical release though
do you mean like gladiator or clash of the titans
that guy was massive
that's a tough question because there are so many i like i would have to say clueless
oh wow that is an old one
have you ever seen any of the predator movies
i just did
and it's action packed
never and some of them were strangely sophisticated
it's one of my all-time favorite movies in fact
she uses ursala the sea witch they make a deal for ariels voice
true but recall the subway sex scene
i know it was cool how she built that castle
i liked at the end when elsa finally got control over her powers
i believe he was he is connected to quite a few good ones
that's quite an amount but i'm sure the movie itself will pull that budget back in and more
it's despicable me 3 i watched the first one but i missed the second one
i do like that guy especially when he was on the office
my favorite animted movie is still wreck-it ralph though
yea the undead sea captain goes after him shall be entertaining how willl jack outwit them this time
except for chimmachangas
i know i wish he would have bee a little more robust like the cartoon lex
what's wrong with that
i hope they add a moana area to disneyland
what kind of movies are available
i agree with you it is always better if the adults like it too
well i think this is one of his most serious movies yet
man i really think i need to watch more animations
that's tough i like so many of them one of my favorites is when frances has to ride out the bad thunderstorm alone in her new villa
yeah showing humanity in the worse situation
that would be meeeee yesssss so what am i going to pick
the movie was long and drawn out and too loud
i don't know if you watch the making of features you can tell he was a guy who was laying down the tracks as the train right behind
that's crazy i'm not a big fan of musicals though
why is it sad
there were some good lines in that movie too
you should watch it he's trying to figure out who killed his wife the ending is really perplexing
good talking to you
yeah i guess i could see how some people might have found the ending a let down though
good

those are both great movies
that's true do you remember girls just wanna have fun with her and sarah jessica parker
he is an amazing filmmaker
it's probably really hard to translate what works on the smaller screen onto the silver screen

it is he ends up becoming really powerful and there are some really awesome fight scenes
another woman who portrayed this role was taraji henson
you should watch it the twist is the best part
is he the lead
i like orlando bloom he was great in the pirates of the caribbean movies
he has done a few lately but you defenitely watched the best one
what is it
yes that did you watch it
sounds good what else do you have in mind
oh no kelly is athletic and can do different kinds of dancing besides tap dancing
they are all so rude and immoral that i don't even laugh once
well it's just the beginning isn't it it gets hairier because as she reads the novel we get to see it unfolding onscreen
yes that is motoko kusanagi
yeah i'd go so far to say as the other three segments kinda sucked
and eating a lot of raw eggs probably played a part in it
no not yet i know there is a movie for dark places but i haven't heard of any others
yes that's the one
well i used to be an avid reader i had purchased the book not knowing much about it except that it sounded like it would be good
i would not say that
surprisingly yes i like how they brought aladdins father into the story
best mob movie in my opinion
what kind of difference
it's called no country for old men it won an emmy or something
yes there were
that sounds really fun to watch
those are really good
yes i have seen that movie too is it that animated movie that all the kids are talking about
i like those type of movies too i do not like science fiction or fantasy movies in the least
it's easy for old technology movies to look outdated very quick but '2001' doesn't at all
most of kubrick's films were he himself actually banned 'a clockwork orange'
picking one is hard but there will be blood
i would say they could probably handle watching it with you
tom skerritt was in it as well
yeah i heard that too
captain america 3 civil war best parody film
oh yeahits so funny
i think playing marianne dashwood was one of kate winslet's first major roles she did an excellent job
yes that one was the best
make sure you watch all three believe me you will not regret it
that was really cute have you seen any of the minions movies
i agree they're okay but i found them somewhat annoying
i'm definitely gonna have to check it out then
good point
it's totally believable too
that's subjective
but it's really meta it shows how ultimately legos are just toys to encourage kids to grow and have fun
oh yes midnight showings every year
i love the story line of all the star wars i liked that jyn never gave up on her father i like cassian determination and willing to do whatever he has to win for the alliance
what is your favorite remake
how about that remake of psycho it was basically a shot for shot recreation
it's better than son of the pink panther for sure
they had a 75th anniversary re-showing
what is it about
maybe add the birds
oh am not even disputing that just meant he's still relevant and should have made a good actor on most of the new movies this year
the contrast of her work as steel worker stripper was pretty great
very good question as far as a general performance standpoint i loved the scene at the jailhouse where batman integrates him
the acting was really good
i liked the setting and the story
yeah that was surprisingly good after the horrendous batman vs superman i had low expectations for it
right the spielbergian light some have tried to duplicate it but can't come close
really why
well i saw nocturnal animals another amy adams movie
they make such a cute couple too they remind me of how cute ruby dee and ozzie harris were as a couple
i suppose not
i loved the ending
i really liked tangled
yeah it truly was amazing and it was made over ten years ago it took them forever to make a sequel
like i said i like them because they are entertaining however i am not going to the movie theater to see them i'm waiting for dvd
i loved the sound track
i can't believe you've never even seen the classics like friday the 13th or nightmare on elm street
that would have to be christopher reeves
it's about a private detective who hunts down murderers
it really is you would love it
i will definitely have to check this movie out as soon as possible
i like to see movies in the theater about once a week and at home the rest of the timewhat about you
well i argue for his seven performance that ending scene when he is with kevin spacey is remarkable
thanks for the recommendation
is that a documentary
true the writing was exceptional as well
you gotta hand it to fox i guess they may not know what to do with the fantastic four but they're doing something right with x-men
it is action packed
it is doing very well in the box office
this one is great ray romano does one of the voices
what movies was she in
oh you know the racist overtones to say it lightly that are in the movie are very offensive
chris wedge is the director
emilio kind of fell off the map didn't he
great movie and charlie sheen was in that film too i forgot about that one
no that was definitely an invasion movie this one is much more cerebral
what genere independant production horror or drama
yeah that one didnt do very well - i think it was called the great wall
yeah the scene from the trailer
yeah the backstory about him was cool though
that's cool man
what's it about
i'd say the two were equal i love denzel washington though
the newest one just erased all the old one
are you looking forward to part 2
why not i thought you loved the first two
isn't that movie kind of old
yeah it had pretty funny moments
i know
i know i am sure some of it is stunt people but a lot of it had to be her
i know i think as much as i love skyfall that is probably my favorite moment from the movie
i would definitely recommend logan you even have to be an x-men fan to watch it although it helps
for me it is a icon movie of the 90s i remember i used to watch it again and again every time i can along with my sister
there is a good story in the film too
why did you think it was the worst
did you like him in the departed
yes they sit up in the cheap seats with all the blacks in town who of course aren't allowed to sit with the white folks down on the main floor of the courtroom
i have seen all his movies but i am thinking it was one where he plays his cousin opposite of himself
what were they called
and some movies have bad pacing
she coulda been somebody she coulda been a contender
yes it is a strange coincidence
no i mean like now
i'm sure the toy marketers loved it
i think it did definitely for the better
they need to do a remake of the green mile and the shining
eh just planning some activities
i catched that one too it was pretty funny
that outstanding it was a pretty bad flick
huh
i really like tangled that was a really well done movie
mine too
i love gerrard butler
peter weller couldn't tell you
have you watched the latest one
it's such a classic if i only had a heart is my favorite song from the movie
well i can't argue with you there
why do you think that is
no i usually don't go out to the theater
i watch 2001 last night it was pretty good but i prefer the book
well this is an interesting topic
it has i haven't seen any reviews yet
so should i watch it
did you like jackie brown
he apparently has killed women and children at least that's alluded to
i thought it was pretty good i am a big musical person though
is he the writer on the movie
will smith in the movie the legend of bagger vance that bagger vance
any one die
you missed nothing
baby dory was adorable and it actually got me emotional
i like a lot of things but right now i'm in the mood for an actionadventure type of movie
i've only heard good things they cast gal gadot as wonder woman and the lady from princess bride robin wright as a major amazon
terminator is one everyone knows even if they never watched the movie
how long was that one
that is am all-star cast
me too he had no choice the carnival barker was being unfair she hit the spaceship
there is also a scream 2 3 4
yeah and patricia arquette
there was a lot of comedic moments in the movie though
me too will ferrell and john c reilly are a great duo
oh then you should watch moana with them
i have not seen that show
awesome
he is a great director
he did a few films with clint eastwood
okay thats better
yes i though iron man was a great turn around for his career
yes some of the best but maybe not the best
and her daughter died
it was really good
i can't do that it sometimes feels torturous
i have two favorites - i can't pick between them
no the long survivor also said that the injuries suffered by the deceased seals were more gory than depicted in the movie
i know i liked the last batman trilogy i thought it had just the right amount of effects and a great story line
i like old muscle cars
yeah that's what i'm seeing
i think the 90's
yes among other things
i think it is i think it's originally french or done by a french director
that's interesting what else
oh okay i watched it in theater
tim robbins and morgan freeman both do a great job in it
yes she was
maybe this will be a case of good the nuns vs evi the posesses doll
lionel barrymore cedrick hardwicke and bobs watson played the little boy
i actually liked the mummy in the original movie better
yes as a special treat for my kid
oh yeah you're right they did plus it's not coming out until october 2017
she's good too were they ever a couple in the movies
colin firth is my favorite actor
yeah
yes i have i felt like i was being abducted by aliens while i watched that
matthew mcconaughey and jared leto
it's about a texas man's-man who gets hiv when most of the people getting it were gay
yes it is the director is chris mckay
and the sweet man that saves her and cleans her up
3 is great but nothing can beat the original
favorite characters
i love woody
right anything that man makes is always great to watch
i have to tell you i was surprised that it won
indeed they had to convince the moonlight folks that they weren't joking
i'll have to check it out who directed it
kelly asbury is the director for it
i think action movies are the best to watch in a movie theater
ok i like to hear that
how so
who was in it anyone i know
that's an oddly specific fear i think those movies are surprisingly well done
i liked black window
then you will definitely appreciate this movie
fair enough my favorite oliver stone film would probably have to be platoon
it is quite different than i had anticipated
yeah he was the crazy man in the car
do you think this success can continue
yeah you're right there
i think that if you do than you can get an idea of how the character evolves
i see
what else did it do did it end well
oh i love that movie that one was so good
i'll say that both movie are kind of similar
yea you should there is a second movie too called horrible bosses 2
i haven't seen it yet but i do love thriller movies
yes its a great movie
wow he must be super happy about the movie
wow poor girl
what was your second favorite
yeah it does they all are so amazing in it
actually that's supposed to be more of a reboot than a sequel
well the young guns can fit the bill but personally the sequel stank
i think i've seen it
but what about their movies
their new sequels
i am not alien trilogy is my favorite movies of the world
i would definitely recommend the jason bourne movies
no i never got around to it
not really there haven't been a lot of good movies to come out
i just watched the boss
and your favorite is butch cassidy and the sundance kid
well do you like any movies from this century
ok well give me one recent movie that isn't well known that you would like me to see
well there aren't car chases but the actress someone named ronan i believe is wonderful and there is the conflict between her being irish and her italian boyfriend
the new movies are not
topol was amazing as tevye
yes i saw a stage version with zero mostel who was known for the part but to me not as good
sounds great
yeah i think he did josh brolin and tommy lee jones deserved oscars too but i think only bardem was nominated and won
awesome sounds like something i should go see and watch
i am not entirely sure because i have not watched to many movies last year
yes i've seen the entire series and the remake
i know right what is your favorite movie of all time
that's kind of a shame i definitely am looking forward to seeing it maybe even more now
that was a good movie
did they do another thanatos tease at the end
anyway i still want to check out justice leage
you like animals too
did you get to see the newest starwars movie the force awakens
how are you
are you crazy he did the role perfect justice
i generally don't either but this one is a must see
well it's not going to be something profound like citizen kane or network
that was a remake wasn't it
i love the scene where he get excited when he sees the hulk
me too harrison ford is such a strong actor he can carry anything
how are you
yeah let me bring it up for you
the scenes are a little dark but it is not bad
no way that is so scary speaking of scary witch movies do you remember the blair witch movie
first they show giant satan and giant satan's penis
never mind then so what about horror
so i was kind of right
like who
yeah maybe he did make another after that
i can usually tolerate the minions and despicable me movies
haven't heard much about it what's the premmise
you have yourself a deal that will certainly be an event
yes he plays the main character star lord
mostly just marvel and star wars but they're releasing so many films between them that it does feel overdone
i have no idea i'll have to look it up
i mean it depends on the situation it's hard to get the plot right
i didn't know they made an old one
thats insane i think youre crazy
yes please do
and forest whitaker won an oscar playing idi amin
ok natalie portman huh she must look really pretty on blue-ray
was it funny
just don't give away the ending and i am fine
they didn't make those
ha time does a terrible thing to those hollywood folk
true i actually thought the watchmen was a really good adaptation
yeah me too
i love him too he is so funny
best 5 sci-fi movies ever
it's a great movie where this man who owns a theater gets a bunch of people to sing and put on a concert
i will definitely have to check and see if i can find that one
some of the movies they offer on demand are old
hi
yeah i agree
i will do that i will know by friday what day i will be able to go
adam sandler ruled the roost
yes i like the way the show how rocky trains the old style way and the russian boxer uses technology
hangover
i read reviews before i went and they weren't that great but i actually liked it
okay i will
the fact that you haven't seen any miyazaki movies blows my mind
i would definitely say that
yeah i bet that's the documentary about the girl whose mother had munchausen syndrome by proxy right
no no it was all gibson he actually has been doing movies here and there for some time now
good
will i like it if i don't like 80s music
this movie kinda made me fear the sound of a spoon hitting the side of a tea cup
it's funny when i saw that i was pretty young and i really didn't think i would like it because it actually was a silent movie
yes and there he runs into his ex and her new boyfriend played by russel brand
the moment where he is watching a video of his son with his newborn and so much time has passed
i think if i had planned on seeing it i would have by now it's been out for two weeks
tough question
i have a couple i love guardians of the galaxy and antman
yes in this one ted wants to adopt a baby
is this the one he goes to court in
i am not sure- i never saw kill bill anyway the first chapter is really about bringing the main characters together there's a black guy who was a major in the union army
yeah this is sort of one of those old men can be cool sort of movies like red and i have to admit he was cool
i'd give it a shot
there is no religious text in christendom that supports that image none there are pagan supports for that but not legit religion
yea i'll occasionally watch foreign films that come out on netflix how about you
i see what you did there
lego batman
what was so different about it
oh you really like westerns
yeah which is why manchester by the sea wasn't really for me
from what i've seen so far the reviews look promising
do you have a favorite charater
for the most part that turner kid was a boring character and for some reason jack don't sound like he used too
the movies about brothers in a fighting competition
i definately want to check it out still
exactly they don't have to worry about establishing name recognition or whether or not something will catch on they know for a fact that if they throw enough money at an existing franchise they're guaranteed to at least get a certain number of fans there opening weekend
yeah i saw the trailers it looks ok
definitely an amazing film and a classic for sure i thought harrison ford was amazing in it
disney bought marvel awhile back
sounds pretty depressing
i thought it was pretty gripping
i didn't think about it that way
i like some of his comedy movies to be honest
have you not seen the trailer
it was okay it's not a movie i would want to watch more than once
oh okay i don't like them that much myself
i think the first one sounds best let's go see the guardians
well one did look like a queen but it was a soldier one
i wonder if the remake is just as long as the original
the next time you're planning to take your children to the movies please let me know maybe we can join up and have one big outing
what they made one of those
i know i'm too busy to pay attention to this stuff
yeah he's another big wrestler who has gone to hollywood just like dwayne the rock johnson
yeah i was surprised by how thought-provoking the film is
okay i think i follow do you think any other horror films comment on race
yeah he hams it up big time in a lot of his recent films in a bad way but for me it's a good thing
though honestly i wouldn't mind seeing him return to his leaving las vegas level of esteem
i like how when they made beerfest they all had completely different characters
yeah it really showed their diversity in acting
that is very funny who else is in mallrats
when it comes to those kind i prefer asian movies
what is it about
hmm let me think
yes she is she stars in the show bates motel too
being in the public is a tough thing
that was hilarious
yeah groot was my favorite as well
really i have to see that
sounds funny
no i haven't seen it yet was it any good
that was the hard part for me to really believe in the original
i was thinking the same thing
they actually did a good job writing in the most of the scenes and made them a little more convincing
speaking of sci fi alien covenant is coming out too
wow that's actually pretty bad
what is a period drama
sorry i can't go tonight but i wanted to see a movie coming out next weekend
great well i think i will head over there tonight and watch it myself
possibly but society is crazy too
my kids love it
fine i don't have a preference over a movie review sites so let's check imdb there you happy
so it's not only the ever-wonderful patrick swayze but also keanu reeves and gary busey have you seen anything else good lately
i just cant see how a kid will fight a villain
oh that's a really tough question i love them all
you are making me jealous
oh nice what else can a man want
that would be cool though i'll definitely miss scott lang as the villain from the first one
absolutely what's your favorite john carpenter movie
it's a mystery set in copenhagen and greenland it's filled with a high moral purpose and clever detective work
at christmas three criminals and their deadly snake escape prison on devil's island that complicates the lives of bogart and his kin
exactly the first part of the movie is interesting and you actually get a feel for who the characters are
i'm sorry it was so bad maybe there will be some better comedies that come out
it is the one with wolverinelogan's story
i guess but she doesn't talk that way normally
yeah that was hillarious
i never really liked spoofs
no i didn't know that what a great meet cute who else was in that movie
only about an hour and a half
it has to suck fighting the forces of evil with your breasts hanging out
awesome come by around 8 ill have some popcorn and wine ready
okay no problem i'm gonna check it out
yes i want to see it too
could they actually sing
that's their first mistake
the star trek series is always great
okay that really sounds pointless
i think that was part of his mental agony he wanted to stop the program from doing what was done to him to others
no i haven't have you
i would bet
i know me too it's awesome that wonder woman is literally part goddess
i would have to say that's a hard question
david yates directed that movie
on the big screen it was as if you were there watching it and being there
oh yah the mean dentist who get nemo while diving
you got the saw films
yea and like i said it is a little slow at times the way to look at it is this isn't a big hollywood blockbuster version of godzilla this is a how realistic can we make something so outlandish kind of movie
what do you mean
with so many great movies it is no suprise george lucas has made a lot of money
what are you crazy everyone loves that movie
the message of the movie is too preachy for me and a bit hypocritical as well
do you got enough
i agree with that what other movies do you suggest
i loved when they got bethoven and forget he could not hear well
yes it's based on a book written by lauren weisberger did you know that
adam sandler makes the movie funny
michael bay is terrible
i don't know it's on the tip of my tongue
how about something action-y
hey did you get to see that one with dicaprio in it
exactly
yeah the one
what do you think the message is
rightyoung frankenstein fame
the dancing was actually really sweet the characters were well developed so yo cared what happened to them
yes with seth rogan
i liked how they mixed animation with real life
well he does talk just hardly anyone can understand him
yeah that makes him really awesome and such a great character
i understand what was the name of the new one anyway
was it on television or did you find it on netflix
oh the rapper
definitely i love them
those were good my favorite was 'spider-man 2' because of doc oc
yes that's the one
at least you gave me that
i love brendan frasier in almost all the movies he has done
and they were great for all ages movies today seem to be geared to one age group
yea he was a little
like taratino
the plot is generally very bad
i absolutely love the minions
i kind of like stuart
i saw it with my boyfriend i liked it too
he had a twin
really and it is funny
i kind of thought that movie was long
i will pick you guys up on saturday if that is a good day
he was so pivotal to the plot in the avengers too
really the commercials always made them look pretty cheesy
sweet we could make it a double feature and go see wonder woman too
it is just a simple love story
no certainly not
i think the most classic cowboy was played by john wayne
how come
that's too bad i thought it was pretty good

i tend to like the ones that have messages like that -- like princess mononoke
no probably what's the survey for
i wasn't too sure about the enchantress though
wow a lot
yeah your right it does have a good cast and laos an interesting story line
like what
what about harry potter and the cursed child do you think that could be made into a movie
oh entirely and that's good the main character what's her face just drove me up the wall
that's true speaking of him did you see dumber and dumber to
and you did an analysis of how the animation looks
they had an eminem song playing
i hope they do something different enough to make it interesting
that was a film with nearly perfect casting
i didnt care for it and also they slept together in the car
yes the last bond movie came out in 2015
yeah i can see that i prefer there to be a good plot too
i think the only one i ever like was the star wars movies
se7en is awesome
yea when he opens the box and the head is inside
have you seen all of john hughes' movies
it also stars ben foster
yes
well he had the 'physical comedy' part down -- that's for sure wrestling when people expected jokes who knew
his dancing was impeccable it was so great that he was in it for sure
seeing how it is one of my favorite movies i would love to go
no i have not
mind if i join you
who
quentin tarantino is a good director
wanna see a movie
you might sit through the longest film you ever saw instead though like meet joe black you're gambling
i agree i bet that's what makes it such a successful movie
oh wow then i'll definitely go see it the same character
yeah i like her
yeah like gremlins and the depression and suicidalness in it's a wonderful life
only some of them
i think there always has been they are just more prevelant now
it was released on may 1 2015
yes that is exactly my point the john wick movies didn't have any of that stuff in it and it was a breath of fresh air in my opinion
what movies do you like
its really good
so do you want to go see it
even though he's british
well i think it was a disney movie but it seemed to have some violence in it so i'm not sure
well that shouldn't be too hard to identify
kind of like grease
i do most animated movies today have a lot of scenes etc that are for both adults and kids
i will thank you for the suggestions
yes actually though i kind of regret them
so not fear inspiring
i'm glad i finally rented it
yes he is
i loved it when he would just pop up out of nowhere with an ak-47
you're talking about the earl of funk the duke of cool ayatollah of rock'n'rolla mr stitch jones
maybe one day they will take all the marvel heroes from the series and make a movie for them
yeah sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not it will be interesting to see where they go with from here
what did you think of it it's a black and white surrealist film from around 1980 i think
i like the raiders of the lost ark series
is that that western film with kurt russell
you like
no they're the best
that's not a movie
with superman gone amanda waller a us offical of questionable moral fiber puts forth her taskforce x program
if you decide you really like them we subscribe to drama fever a great streaming channel
it was way too young for carrie fisher and star wars too though
i think like king kong and stuff
fine
i'm not sure i really like 'reservoir dogs' but i think he's a better writer than anything else
it was but only for about a week it was a box office dud but is a cult classic now
they just came out with the 8th one they are all really good
classics not your thing huh
so what is it
bring it bro
i'm really not sure i like it but i don't at the same time
what a nice bit of trivia i never knew that
bad dramatics cheap explosions for everything etc
ah the evil uncle
how old is she
i don't know if that seems that interesting
did john carpenter do it
i liked the scene where they went to the diner
are she and steve carrel married
i seen it i liked the trope it has
i like that and crouching tiger hidden dragon
she was so so beautiful i remember i wanted to be her
i loved the mix of humor in that one
yeah that's probably it
no i didn't wasn't he the greasy haired butler in the movie
explain what you mean please
that's what i was planning to do
oh man so many good scenes
i also did not enjoy that one too much
she was pretty dope
was it good


oh really i feel like they did that already
oh ok but its still a fast and furious series
i mean the way ash throws off those one liners swallow this was just awesome
it sure wasn't moonlight or la la land
i like captain american and thor those were good movies
yes once you've had superman save the world then how can you up the stakes in the next movie it gets ridiculous
plaaaayaaaaaa
i've been waiting to see the second guardians of the galaxy
what do you mean why would you want them to be worse
the first one is my favorite so i understand
yeah i miss the old man in the first movies he was so misguided but had amazing ideas
have you seen i know what you did last summer
ok what about sci-fi
i saw girl on a train
what is one of your favorites then
there is a lot of funny scenes in the movie with him
i'm sure i will
yes i loved it jason bateman was too funny
i don't think one can call jennifer anniston old she is beautiful
what would the plot be then
those were good and his older movies too like snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels
i don't know a lot about old movies except maybe some hitchcock
true
he got game
does it end well
well the only one i knew was glenn close
oh wow i love that show vikings
hopefully the accents don't get too off track that makes me nuts
not all the same night but 3 times will show you how good an idea it was whoever thought of it
i thought it had way too many characters that went nowhere but the action was good
i agree i think the storyline really failed the movie

i liked her performance best in out of africa
i did like special effects a lot
you can't be serious
oh let's seei saw passengers over the weekend watched the founder a couple of weeks ago
what's your favorite kevin smith film
you have to see it it's one of his best yet it's like zack and miri make a porno meets toy story
oh god that would be awful
i like comedy show and action movies what about you
in real life or which actor
yeah he was perfect casting i like the hulk
what is it about
it'sthe tile of the movie with the dad and the boy they're trying to survive in an apocalyptic future worst ending ever
i also say lego batman with my kids that was pretty good
okay okay i have seen some exaggerated scenes but they still get my adrenaline pumping
comedies are much more entertaining

yes i've watched it several times it came out in the 80's didn't it

some of the superfluous stuff was boring though like the scenes with scarlet witch and vision
jules and verne will be in their twenties and behaving irresponsible
what else do you like
i really want to see dunkirk
all the stand alone ones or just the avengers movies
it was pretty good i couldn't take my eyes off of it another good one is hacksaw ridge that's a true story too
wasn't one of my favorites but i guess it's worth a watch
no i think it's all what he hoped would happen i think he either died or is jail
there are several movies i don't like as much as the soundtrack
i like him too you think he's the best bond
yeah i agree i wish he'd do more movies
have you seen his movie dream house
is it a long movie
it's about the salem witch trial thing
what is your favorite movie you've seen so far this year
jennifer lawrence was great in those did you see passengers
what
that doesn't answer my question
probably captain america civil war
actually no i thought at first that they might give her a way to relive those memories but when she revealed she didn't have a child then i knew that she was only going to have those memories going forward
i did and thought it wasnt that good
so that means you've never seen let the right one in
ohi don't like vampires movies anyways too scary
flubber classic lost to the times ever see jumanji
i've always been a fan of penelope cruz
they have plush seating alcoholic drinks and good dinner food
i like comedies for the theater action is good too
overall or just the first movie
oh yeah me too killed it unlike the last one
i loved baby groot
why i heard it was supposed to be really good
what was your favorite part
yeah you can't say that about a lot of movies
i've never seen that
yes it does unfortunately they did not utilize the cast until ben kingsley came into the movie
of course edward scissor hands is my favorite how about you
no i have heard of it i like fear and loathing in las vegas too
i saw it but i wasn't too thrilled about it
how do you feel about big daddy
it was we saw it when it released in 3d i thought my head would explode
i'm free are there any other movies you want me to bring
i guess there's a whole scavenger backstory
well first off you have to forget everything you know about the original king arthur stories
it is a jedi name
so he's not just stealing bodies he's recruiting new dead people too
i know and eddie mueller who did the commentary on the dvd is going to be there as well
well the plots are bad now adays
it's not a horror movie
did you not know that darth vader doesn't say luke i am your father
that's even sadder
i will check the time also on tv or movie
what was so great about it
inglourious basterds i think it's the height of both his dialogue and his characters
i'm in the midst of watching all the tarantino movies and so far basterds is my favorite
they even have a run while the floor around you is collapsing trope in the trailer which i hate
was it kind of like batman vs superman
i saw alien covenant last weekend
at halloween let's watch the phantom of the opera and nosferatu
you have to like groot though
did you liked it
not that much personally for me it was a let down for disney
i'll have a team of well educated and anal historians working on it
genghis khan was born in the 12th century
do you think you would have traded places with you little sister so she didn't have to go fight like katniss did in the movie
how graphic
it was really good we streamed that new movie the secret life of pets
we may have to check that one out i love it when she watches movies with strong female lead roles
isn't vin diesel in it
maybe comedy i could use a good laugh
no not at all way too gory for me
do you have any favorites
nope they casting was horrible in that movie
that would be the cat
you know what other movie she was in that was really good the martian with matt damon
good choice me too
that also has violence
yes i would love to see a 2017 version of open range
yes it was
oh i see so what did you think of this last one
oh that's too bad i really like their characters
and if you remember they didn't get much time together in the last one
probably 'eragon'
i remember being so disappointed as a kid
ok that is an interesting field
yes he was great a funny man to look at but a great actor
i really liked it
do you like remakes of movies
those were excellent
nope me either
the usual suspects
is it
the shining
is that the movie with the groot
okay
i can see that
who's in that one that i might know
thanks i shall do that
well i totally loved it it brings back the roots of the series
ricki and the flash into the woods complicated julie julia doubt mamma mia the devil wears prada the hours the house of spirits choice
no i am talking about the original
don't you think he's a superhero
oh yes very funny
you know i have never seen it
i hope they never try to remake it you can not redo that right
ok i will give them a shot i suppose
do you have a favorite
yes i think the hateful eight doesn't really capturing what is going on well in the movie- they're all actually distrustful of one another and they audience gets to feed on that mistrust
wow that is a unique element of a movie
yep i agree and that's why it's up there for me
okay professor i like it because it has the most action by far and the biggest villain to bring down and he does suffer the consequences in the future
well that's not a boxing movie it's a movie about a guy wearing sweatpants that contains occasional boxing even when there is boxing it's not very much
okay im sold lets go see the kong movie
well i just got back from the movies and headed to the bar now
wanna meet up we can talk about the movie
like most of the american pie films
yeah it's called let me in
you know with the teen actors of the eightees
you mean molly ringwald and all of the other ones
yes but not all of them are currently acting actors we can see another 80 are out of work actors
and you think why making it is so hard
yes he's had lots of roles
what did the last one get
okay sure have you seen minority report
jason statham was hilarious in that
okay i see and the mystery wasn't so mysterious
well they got redeemed i think it was a message about society
then you should see the movie argo
oh i already saw that one really great acting wow i couldn't believe the story which other then
what
indeed
so what were the discrpencies
oh that is a great one him and drew barrymore make a great team
yes it is very excited to watch it a little scarrie
no i don't think so but you can check but it showing on tv
yeah like the new jurassic park films
i wonder why they remake so many movies like that
that's what the studio figures but i don't buy it we can handle the bad guys winning
i could go for a comedy
i never laughed so hard in my life just when you thought it couldn't get any crazierit does
it's not the best film but it certainly won't ruin your memories of the first movie
have you seen him on other movies other than doing captain america or in the fantastic four
my least favorite was baby
indian-american documentary film about the children of prostitutes in sonagachi kolkata's red light district the widely acclaimed film
they probably do it seems like a fun job
i want to buy the dvd
yes the guy with the curly hair
was it a long movie
maybe you would
you like the first one better though
yeah i am a huge comedy lover so i tend to watch a lot of comedy movies
did you like anything about it
sure have i would have to say my favorite is ant-man i thought that one was really good
how old is that don't recognize the name
you want to go to the theatre
oh yes that one yes i have seen it
will smith has made his name among black actors
whatcha watching
true no other movie would have that
thanks for the suggestion
did you read the story
i have seen superbad
alright then basically it's about a guy living in a ghetto neighborhood in southern california that experiences conflicts particularly on friday
i don't have to take this abuse i'm leaving i'm tapped out anyway
the numbers do echo my sentiments as well
saw it loved it
let's go see one together
i like almost all genres but i'm really feeling a romantic comedy right now
it's about an adventurous guy who gets into an accident and becomes a paraplegic his parents hire someone to take care of him and it ends up being a romantic comedy with a twist at the end
of course
eh if you ask me i think their is
that's a really good one
maybe they ran out of secrets
oh yes it is one of the best action movie series i have ever seen
yeah for some reason the name of the movie is escaping me
oh right wait did he direct suicide squad
the secret lives of pets
no i guess they weren't rick springfield was in general hospital
yep but still wick refuses saying he's retired so santino blows up his house
yup it's a slow one too
who are the actors in the movie
there's always a hot girl or two
she did one called five too very in depth and drama filled
dawson's creek
i no all of us will enjoy the dayit will ladies day out
the great martin scorsese
they are often badly paced and drag
i actually think he is awful
do you know what rating does it have
what is it about
oh i have seen that one it is great
for instance and i think this is the best by far jackson was a former union soldier and he goes around wearing his old military uniform which was thick made him look like a giant and it had a cape
i think they will marvel studios hasn't had a flop yet
the first one was good though
yes and the guy from the office and tons of cameos they get funnier and funnier
i am trying to compile a list of the best sports movies
yeah sometimes you need that brevity in a film to make it good
how many incredible hulk movies have you seen
do you like frank sinatra or bing crosby better
i heard the book was good gripping
solid guilty
yeah
sound good i will keep that in mind
plus i will let you no what time the moves start in the after noon
thanks sound good i will be waiting
it started out as a good story
i mean they let jason die so he comes back for revenge
i know i hate a crowded theater
how did you like it
yeah it was so funny
is it available on dvd yet
no which one was it i lost track
besides it was probably just a handful of guys
i think so and the people came back home
a teen disney movie
yes i think so
oh how was that
yes that will be fine and bring some children if you like
ok i will do just that
tom cruise is just too strange nowadays
well not only can he scare you he can also make you laugh
can't think of all of them off the top of my head but he did
i saw frozen
i didnt like it that much actually
another good one that comes to mind is jumanji it has a couple of bad words in it but it is mostly fine for kids to watch
did you just criticize independent movies
i don't remember i think he's just mental
i'm suprised he didn't get one for django
well i'm glad he finally is recognized by the acadamy
he plays kylo ren
i remember him he was great
wow that is a tough question there's more than twenty of them
who is threatening him
oh wow
i forgot that they even made a finding nemo sequel please tell me it's good
and so happens that's where the chapter 2 picks up wick heads on over to pick up his car and kills a bunch of people
forrest gump what is daniel day lewis' best performance
yes i saw manchester by the sea
vi is awful and was made to market to kids the happy ending and teddy bears overthrowing the empire
weren't there two of them
the old xmen did to an extent
what movie is your favorite then
i agree
yes i really liked it jane seymour is beautiful
how much they made
chevy chase is great
well i just go with the it's about a mysterious woman who happens to look like bette davis theory myself but i've heard some other interesting ideas
i think the early 40's she plays a fiesty saloon owner
did you see snowpiercer
appriciated
i thought it was good you don't see too many serious movies with black people as leads in them
yeah alot like which ones
no i have heard of it i like driven too ever see it
have you seen it
how do you feel about mark wahlberg being in them
i haven't does it look good
no it looks pretty awful to be honest
vampires and stuff yea i heard about that
yes hes the best for sure
yeah she is i like brunettes
so why can't they do a movie set in the feudal period or the old west
oh that's a good idea let's go to this cinema we have been last time
i think in novevember
why not they had her in rouge one
on top of creating them they have to render the amount of computer power required to render that much cgi is mind boggling
ohi think that might have been used
i think i like her more than most people but i don't watch her that much
ummi think there was another one but i did see into darkness the other night
really i don't think i've seen any in years
oh i used to watch them all the time then
see that spork i am going to take that spork and stab you with it
it was the dolorean
ok so what made it so cool
i'd like to see it sometime what did you think
well i've only watched the first four i'm kind of confused
the same thing happened when i watched anabelle
your funny
i love ground hog's day the movie
oh like the saw series
yeah i also like to stay away from aliens or fantasy stuff too
and that teenage girl was a bit too dramatic
so what is your favorite tarantino movie
it was i'm not a huge fan of brosnan though
oh man i have been dying to see that
true i'm not much of a buff
yes very much like that film have you ever seen an other shakespeare films
yeah it was kind of dull i do like period pieces like that have you ever seen roxanne
your parents let you watch that stuff
have you every seen her movie pretty in pink
alien invasion movies are usually escapism war movies are closer to horror films if anything
they could if they actually read the comics
yeah guardians of the galaxy 2 came out earlier this month
well i'll give him that he was also the best portrayal of popeye hands down
it certainly is it involves 1 identifying what a film is 2 choosing the best from each decade or so 3 narrowing down to that one film that everyone if not most would agree as the best film of all time
j j abrams did he had felicity and alias before he made it big
yes jack haley
yep not even once
i'm crazy
no but it's decent popcorn fare
yeah the casting was perfect in that movie norton and bonham carter did great too
i know i would never think kevin spacey could be such a scary character
have you ever read the comic book
i guess it was my kind of movie
that's what most like about it
that guy is good
this is mind blowing amazing dude you should definitely go check it out
duh but there's like a million versions of blade runner
it's like a long episode
i seem to like tv show movies
maybe i don't know you liked titanic didn't you that had a ton of dramatic license
ashton kutcher did a good job in that film
like in dude wheres my car
did it seem like the dogs were mistreated
well it was the german shepherd that was getting the attention for mistreatment
i do know any good ones
i don't know about that but i do know music is an important part of movies
yes i know which one you are talking about now i did see it did you like the movie
from your brain
that can't be the real question let me see the card
whet your place or mine
me too
no it would be a huge film
yeah the duke was pretty cool i saw butch cassidy and the sundance kid with my sister that was a neat western and pretty funny at times
i love them the mcu is one of the best things to happen to movies lately
yeah the wonder woman movie will be a great start to kicking off solo movies for more of the justice league characters
it's not that bad
yeah it was zootopia to no one's surprise i think
well for one thing that while family is important and all sometimes family is also cruel and it's not wrong to try to escape that
i mean themes aside that animation was absolutely amazing
all 3 of the main actors did a great job
i would concur with you on that
it was a book i didn't know that
well i don't think you should trust those online reviews
the original star wars
i didnt not like it if thats what you are asking
no did you
do you
no i don't really care for them
who's your favorite actress
could you see him doing more than just those kinds of films
i have no seen many i like gone with the wind
i have never seen it i hear about it alot
yep teh movie was made based off the game clue really funny great halloween movie
i am a fan of his just not very true to the original material i would have rather seen matthew mcconaughey as the gunslinger roland
you know the movie where some blonde is dumped by her boyfriend on the eve of their vacation
no i don't go to the theater a whole lot anymore
wow i like wolverine movies
yeah even though she was young at the time she gave an amazing performance
what about megan fox
just look at hollywood actresses act like divas all the time
and dont get away with it that much
this movie really creeped me out
definitely not the dialogue was bad the plot holes were so large you could drive a truck through them it was just a disaster
i heard they are making a real life little mermaid i wonder if they will do many more real life versions
ya she is so beautiful actually just read she is going to be in the dumbo movie
i think we may see a movie about the election and campaigns
ok so you think more directors will pay attention to accuracy
it is a thriller film
an old yellow dog that a boy befriends
that's a tough one i love them all in different ways
girl maybe i have to work this weekend do you think it will be good
oh i gotcha i know what you mean i just didn't know what they were called
but i mean aside from that i thought the filming was great and the actors did a good job considering they weren't anybody i had ever seen before
and another recent one called i don't feel at home in this world anymore
i know and just that creepy hotel it was so well done
lugia was really cool though
see that's what i'm talking about iron man 3 doesn't fit with the rest of the movies
what do you like
yeah but he's not really one of the main characters
it was fun but corny
nohow about you
was it nice
yes of course if you like
matt damon is one of my favorite actors of all time
the new spider man
what do you mean
what did you think
it had the guy who plays francais from malcom in the middle
so what kind of movie was hang out
it's computer animated like toy story only better just watch it and you'll like it
yeah i dig them
they usually are
is it primarily a love story
how so
it's about these 2 guys that were on a baseball team when the outbreak happened they end up traveling together trying to survive
it's actually a foreign movie so you probably won't know the actors
there's three i thought there was only two
a sound engineer who creates all of the body sounds you hear -- like clothes rustling footsteps bumping into stuff named after a prominent one -- bob i think
yikes so bad
i still think the script was well written
that movie is so overrated
you like lord of the rings though
it was super strong
there were 2 sequels
this movie sounds hilariously bad
that's crazy what did he think
can not say i have
jane seymour
you know somebody pull up on me at a red light and i'm packing
awesome
but we can't decide which one because we don't like things about them
i know it's about a guy and an older lady
the cinematographer deserves a clap
oh with george clooney now that was a good flick
oh i agree his best performance yet
yeah i would agree with what you said
how many of the guys do you think ever made anything in comedy after that
i think it is the action that draws them in
right then they sent him off to college and now he is not more
who's your favorite character in the transformers i mean transformer
did you like it
john mayer is in it believe it or not
what else
well i didn't see too many movies in my youth but grease made a big splash and i did see that one
can you explain further
it is so funny that stan lee still makes an appearance in every movie
it really is that's half the reason i like it right there
yeah like rear window
back then parents were a lot more conservative about what they let kids watch on tv and at the movies no violence scary stuuf cussing sexual scenes
its mysterious and intense at its best
was he in the marvel universe
did you know during the epic final shoot out al pacino burned his hand on the gun
well the same thing happens in both part one and two i can't tell if it's a remake or a sequel
well either way you've convinced me to check em out
i love that movie
i love how she got to see her parents at the end
what do you think of that movie
yeah it's one of my favorites too it was on television the other day
it seems like they should've had a sequel to that one
do you mean at ridgemont high
do you like chuck norris
yeah and you've got mail has parker posey sleepless in seattle wishes parker acted in it
like the jem and the holograms movie that was a wreck
when he reads the signed book from clarence i get a big lump in my throat watching that movie is one of the best parts of christmas
yeah he does the mostly common i guess he wanted to change his scenery
uh maybe that sounds kind of familiar guessing it's a zombie film
i think so
they still stand the test of time the pacing is slower than we're used to these days but the gags and the slapstick are just as good
how did you know that
the main protagonist was unlikable and didn't grow as a character at all
apparently several animators left and they used a new team
i think it came out around the same time as the great mouse detective
it was a great movie
i have to see that
i get what you mean i didn't give it a chance until a year after it came out
does he like adam sandler burt reynolds was in the longest yard with adam sandler and it was pretty good
i have started to watch a lot of movies from before our time and i am really enjoying them
i do not know his name was the last thing he ever wrote
i think russel has good chemistry with his on screen co stars
yeah totally crying
remember dollar movies did your home town have those
did it actually make a difference you think
i was pleasantly surprised
either that or disney haha
it stars lindsay lohan and rachel mcadams
i can see that it's probably ingrained in them
too bad it looks fun after seeing the movie i wanted to play
mandy moore
ya it gets stuck in your head easily
he is from deal or no deal
yes especially when you saw the two coffee cans with their ashes in them at the top of everest
wasn't he the russian guy in one of the rocky movies
it's clear because so many of them went on to have such great movie careers
was that the one where he had multiple personalities
if you like the 60's there is the girl group of all times called the supremes with dianna ross
i would have to say demi moore i have always loved her movies
mary plays joon and actually benny is played by aidan
wow it sounds really good
either one
it was animated and really cute about a fish and his father
yes i guess but anyways it was horrible which other horrible movies have you watched
it seems like they just get better and better did you see tangled
really
were there any actors i would recognize
that's a good example if an extreme one poltergeist was supposed to be a family movie you know
do you watch the entire thing through
the one with the rock kevin hart jack black and karen gillan
yeah i just saw the trailer today and it brought back so many memories from the original jumanji i watched as a kid
it was the uss enterprise
i do do you want to borrow it
like i said we both some star wars freaks we seen them all
did you take your kids to see it
the remake was horrible
what all do you think you will do with your free time
well of course tom hanks splash definitely goes on the list what else
i'm going to have to go home and watch that one now
really what scared you about it
especially when she melted i used to close my eyes during that part
yeah when it was released i went and saw it in imax it made the movie so much more enjoyable
well it takes place during the christmas season in the movie a christmas party in the nakatomi plaza is interrupted by the terrorists
it wasn't that bad i know people are cynical today but i thought it was fitting for the situation they were in
it does in this case but wouldn't in a jason movie he's too serious
this was sandler's finest work
yeah he was cool with alot of the snl cast as well
how can a movie fit that many genre's must be really good yes i am being sarcastic
this is true because some of these people you didn't know if they were still around or not
overall the the average marvel movie is better than the average dc moviebut dc hit a homerun with thedark knight
groundhogs day
chris elliot was in it too right
well it would depend which day
yeah its pretty good its one of the netflix original movies
well i think he is great in every role he plays however his accent was rather lacking
that surprises me that sounds like a recipe for success
is that the one where he goes to vietnam to rescue pows
yes my family and i loved it so did some of my friends
see i dont like sappy movies
what's the wait then
yeah it got a little more complex that was definitely interesting
yes that's the one audible gasps from the crowd
overall though i think i give it an 8 for being nostalgic and different
and the hair gel scene
those movies were nothing like the movies made from books today
did you see her in the movie with mark whalberg
it was fun
she was fun
sort of yes he is definitely not a cop but has several ties to the fbi in the film
the denzel washington one based on a play
yeah fences
i gotcha well i really liked zachary bennett in cube zero
yeah i know but the specifics are lost on me
tom cruse's new movie
yea you're right i guess it was pretty cool
true that
which role stands out the most to you
yeah me too i heard it was really good
well what does that mean
well it's nothing to write home about
i liked him in the mummy
bela lugosi was such a good actor
yeah i did see the new pirates of the carribean movice and the new gardians of the galxy movie and they were btohj pretty good
it would not be as good
isn't he the bad boy in it that's always the best character
yeah but she does't age so i guess she would lose him anyway
yea i think gina davis played her
was it shot on location somewhere
it was shot in england and the buildings are so great looking
yes the music is going to be phenomenal
no i don't like him i love him
yeah it really did i think it's also a musical
are they anything like twilight
that's a cute name for an elf
i seen this good space movie about a month ago called life have you heard of it
i didn't either it was so dumb it wasn't really funny
the two of them work well together
so it's not something that could actually happen
and mr miyaga showed him up and the beginning of the 2nd movie
that could be good could be bad if i remember that cartoon is was really campy
it was nominated for 2 ocars
me too it had such a great story line
of the two i'd go the last unicorn
i love the premise first of all the idea that peter pan the boy who never grew up in neverland followed wendy to the real world and grew up to become a stressed out yuppie who forgot how to play is priceless
he was nuts running around in his underwear on the racetrack
he was pretty good in old school too
how many
hopefully they dont do a sequel
how could anybody tell that
better than okay to bad that heath ledger died in january the same year the movie came out
i really did and it really helped that nolan is a master story teller he wrote the screenplay for the dark knight with his brother jonathan nolan
i saw it in theaters and i loved it emma watson played a great belle
i saw the cinderella remake and i wasn't too impressed
bye
pretty much who else was in it
i'm not sure who they are
that is so cool
oh same here i wonder what happened to those actors
i liked the first 2 i never saw the one that was in theaters
that's true
yeah but he had good reason to be
wish i could of had that experience
like when he stuck out the whammer
uma thurman is a great actress
that was a cool scene
lion king
and there was a comic book
but they went through their issues too
i actually also like neighbors zac effron is pretty funny
dee wallace was in it
a supermarket mostly
well i'll have to check it out i've been wanting to see the batman one but i'll watch this one first
sometimes it is repetitive
i usually do but this movie wasn't cheesy like the other films he's in
captain america and it's sequels and the iron man series is a must watch to know the back story
no problem thanks for inviting me to go with you
i loved pitch perfect and of course pitch perfect 2 wasn't quite as good but i really liked when fat amy was singing to bumper
there's a new cast member ruby rose from orange is the new black
well what would you say was your favorite
well i was thinking of having everyone wear suits
wow that's a good choice
i would have watched it
that is a great one
in great britain i think it is england
they went to new trier high school
it is a comedy
you know me i like the classics
was that a clark gable movie
so was i it had a great impact when i saw it in theaters
while i'm happy about that because i do really love james mcavoy and michael fassbender
harold ramis directed it he was good at getting the comedy right
naw my dude i just seen the previews
what
unlike the trash that was zoolander 2
yes my son has been watching all the trailer's for it over and over
oh yes i saw that i got a kick out of it
i am sure it can what all do you plan on doing with all of that free time
are you going to see it
yes it is cute
yes and i think she was a coach on the xfactor
is it good
i'm not sure i had considered that who voices puss again
yeah it showed how ruthless he was becoming
kevin spacey is excellent in the movie i'd definitely give it a watch if i were you
kind of it's based on a comic book series
you are correct about that
who samuel l jackson
i do as well i own that and boondock saints ii
like at all
thats it
good because i don't have much time free for the next few weekends
oh that was a tough one to watch
i love that song
wow that's pretty freaky
what happens later in the movie
cool i'm excited
oh yeah i really liked match point she was really good in that
i love kid movies
ron is funny but i like hermione she is very witty
what did you think of it
i thought the same when i first watch it
i loved it a bunch of misfits forming a team to take on the greatest threats of the universe
ah mulholland drive is great
oh my god i can't believe you just said that
funny how all three of them never played such characters before
that seems to signal really bad directing
it feels like the world is being run by teenage boys
i remember dee wallace but i can't remember anyone else
i believe it is opening on july 7th
that wasn't a bad one i actually really enjoyed all of the saw movies
now we're talking nostalgia when it comes to horror i'll take gore over ghost movies any day
oh the music is good i like that they used modern music we listened to already
i remember that i don't know why it was so funny but it was
yeah it bombed at the box office
i have seen a few
yeah you should watch it it deserves the score it has
this one is the continuing adventure of gru and lucy and their daughters
yea and i am sure they will come out with all sorts of new toys based on the movie
wow i can't believe they are already at number nine i heard there was a lot of drama recently with michelle rodriguez
yes they use the giant goose to help guide the geese home
not to that extent
exactly they announced that he has joined the project
life uh finds away
have you ever heard of the devil's triangle
it made almost 290 million at the box office it's in third spot for the highest selling films of this year
oh yeah
yes it would
oh i see so what happens
wow you really like the older one
i agree that's why i usually wait for videos to come out on blu ray
but heathers can be the second best cult movie
you always miss little things in the movie
i had not heard that that's interesting
the magnificent seven
yeh the fantastic four
i'm down to watch that one
i know there is debate on whether evil dead 2 is a sequel a remake or a semi-spoof
that was a funny movie
i don't know i heard it might be tom hardy
