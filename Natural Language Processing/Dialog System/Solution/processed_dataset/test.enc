maybe but its the truth
i have my theories some may assume is han and daughter but thinking more of daughter or obi-wan granddaughter
that's sad
what do you think of the connection between rae and kylo
i don't know ultimately i really don't think the prequels were necessary
a lot
did you know that mark hamel went to my high school
right even disney was buying into the light vs dark dichotomy
the original is much different than the new updated ones
you evil villain
yeah the flashbacks of han chewy and leigh were questionable
like the luke guy trying to kill the vader guy
wow what else
princess leia was not afraid of him at all
i liked how obi-wan cut anakin up though
what is your favorite star wars movie
that's a pretty cool name is she strong
well depends on what my choices of side are
ha he was annoying but the actor playing anakin was so stiff i did not care for his performance
i like how the newer movies give more attention to the female characters
yes i did it was an amazing experience
the first one was the original released in 1983
battlefront 2 battlefront 1 all of the battlefronts basically
yeah it had no kick and was a straight shooter
yes i really like the things on their heads
i think yoda is up there for me he is so wise and masterful what about you
obi wan kenobi sounded so heart broken
that's not how their guild is organized i don't think besides a lot of them are happy with the arrangements
rouge one a new hope
not many i have to say that was very unique for a star wars movie it's one of the few that i actually did like
i've been watching chasing amy too much i can't get the star wars scene out of my mind
he was okay but i'm not a fan of the prequels
i think so too k-2s0 is much more advanced in interaction and of course humor
of course my choice is the original trilogy
i also like the original trilogy more
that seems like a big risk
maybe not sure 100 i would have liked to see those two fight it out
she is a great actress
so the basic idea is to go back to episode iv a new hope and follow the implicit and expected plot points and developments as if the other movies didn't exist in their current form
no and vader's power was a bit more limited than one might expect seeing that in the first movie he had to obey an order from grand moff tarkin
and each part of the wing had a gun on it
but they aren't though i guess not until the prequels anyway
i have enjoyed them all and sincerely loved some the force awakens was amazing
i agree it was my favorite hands down
no way look at the way darth maul nearly defeated both qui gon and obi wan at the same time
i am too did it say when it was coming out
they would get into all those blaster fights
well darth vader was a sith he was just reuniting his family and following his beliefs
it's hard to say but i am scared for the worst given the circumstances i hope they give her a good send off
what did you think about him appearing in the newest movies again
she was played by felicity jones
they killed of solo
so what's that have to do with monsters
i would love to see who he is maybe he's someone we already know
they were evil
a blaster then
i guess so but couldn't just one of them had lived ride off into the sunset and never return
true but rey has the force
the space battles
you like star wars
i'm still wondering who this snoke character actually is
no the death star is a space station not a planet
why did the jedi care
well
i always loved the deep voice of darth vader in the first movies
that left you hanging for sure
yeah it scared me when i was a kid
did the carbonite break the handcuffs i have so many questions now
what is your favorite star wars movie
return of the jedi
he's scary
well it's good to want things i don't think we'll ever see that movie though
kylo ren helped destroy an entire star system
yes they could cut through anything
some of them were ugly
hello my friend
what you watching
force awakens was the only movie in which leia doesn't use a weapon
if you could be any star wars character who would you be
those are the ones that were released in the 2000s
did vader make it
princess laya
darth maul was awesome and the new double sided lightsaber was really cool as well
yea i liked that too
do you think he dreamed up this world when he was a kid
gandolf frodo samwise gollum legolas aragorn bilbo and plenty more
why that had a great story about the redemption of vader and luke finally becoming a full jedi
you should
ouch sorry for you then
who was your favorite character in the force awakens
jabba any day
he's the grand master how can you say that
so then what do you want to watch this weekend
i absolutely adore star wars
i kind of think maybe it had to do with letting vader know he had no power over him that he wasn't going to really win
ill look into them
who is your favorite star wars hero
i did about 20 years ago
why do you think star wars never has a solid family unit
if somehow boba fett could show up in some scenes i would be forever grateful
take your time
is general leia going to be in it since carrie fisher died
i think the new order or whatever looked way too glossy the empire was crushed now there's a bigger empire suddenly
i think they're so adorable and i liked how they kicked some stormtrooper butt in that battle on endor
she's beautiful but poised in a world facing danger
wasn't he in the first one
he looks a lot different doesn't he
there was that creature standing next to him
the end was reminicent of the d-day landing
are you ready or the next one to come out
yeah but she automatically knows how to fly ships and fight
jar jar binks was so annoying and he didn't do anything to help move the plot
yes hayden christensen's acting was so bad it was unbearable to watch sometimes
did you see the original star wars in the theater
which character do you think has evolved the most
i watched a video in kids reactions to it
information which the characters already knew he doesn't do much at all besides eat up time
i like the beard on him gives him an obie wan feel
yea my dad and i went to see it in the theatres
i agree kylo ren is more of a wannabe dark lord but acts more like a rebel child
thats so cool
yes but that's really the only similarity
i have one feeling that she is kylo ren's twin since in the book series han solo and lea had twins
i think the wookies lived there
the wookies helped a lot
that's true do you think obiwan will show up any
i'm not real keen on him either
why him
it would be the comic version of yoda and you
are you looking forward to the last jedi
which of the original trilogy was your least favorite
i think it bring together the original 3 and the spisodes 1 2 and 3 so well
why him
you don't think darth vader was a better villain
well some of them master the force faster than others like annakin did
then what was his name
yeah sure
that's easy
yea him and chewbacca are such an unlikely pair but someone how it works so well
hi
i don't have one
let me explain more depending on the movie you're watching the number of toes he has changes
who's your favorite character on star wars
gotta go with chewie
ok salacious crumb
i think he'll be very yoda like all serious and stuff
yes they are
they were more than just a group of guerilla fighters
i havent heard of him
do you still remember it
but you liked rogue one
how do you feel about the new star wars movies
i felt like that actor did a good job though of playing that part
something to do with it not being semetrical
what scenes stood out to you the most when you first saw the movies
too true
really why
who played darth vader any clue
absolutely
yeah and luke skywalker is her brother
actually that's not what he says
yeah she was not afraid of anything
did you ever wonder where the rancor came from
yes the new ones
well when darth vader dies defending luke i kind of thought that the loose of family was what drove him nuts
did you see rogue one
no i dont think his kind of ship would matter
that was an awesome game
that's not fair chewbacca is cute too
i really like chewy he doesn't say much but gets the job done
what is your favorite scene in the three older movies
i used to try to perform jedi mind tricks on everyone
hahaha did it ever work
my too
samuel l jackson who was your favorite character
would be as fast as anakin
yeah han was a better person
yeah here's something i find weird i've heard different explanations for that big explosion of blue energy
yeah me toohave you played any star wars video games
i really loved the new rogue one movie
i really liked that one too it seemed closer in tone to the original movies
that's tough probably han solo
there is gonna be a new star wars movie coming soon
you know what i never understood about star wars
your dog reminds me of someone
i would've liked to see finn express more remorse about it though
i wonder what tore them apart the falcon maybe
star wars is more than just movies it is fun to collect all the memorabilia too
holy cow you may actually be on to something
and the characters are great
no man i totally agree
we should totally go see the new star wars movie together
who are the characters you like the most
are you a big fan of star wars
i have a replica lightsaber
i liked the force awakens as well
i guess i suppose they definitely have a different feel than the rest of the series up to that point
really
it seems like it's such a timeless franchise
he really does
yep i guess she was drawn to han's bad boy appeal
yes they are great movies
not really
i remember et in star wars he was in the senate in episodes 1-3 right
episode i that was awful
ok it had it's high points
that sounds amazing
yes have you seen them
wouldn't that make her a solo
i love the galaxy that they are set in
there is so much action and adventure in these
what did you think of revenge of the sith
i did too i'm pretty sure it was the first movie i ever went to at the theater
what did you like
i have no idea but i really like the special effects
well lightsabers are basically lasers
it's possible that wookies have a different culture and express grief different than humans maybe hugging him would not be the correct thing to do
so what color lightsaber is the best
which is why i keep saying they need to remake the originals
you don't think so
you must be a huge fan which is your favorite
well they sort of cant do that
you have gotta be joking
were you upset when han died
i liked it a lot but i think the plot was so similar to a new hope that it felt more like an homage than a new movie
i'm so confused who was han solo's dad
know anything about the new han solo movie
he wouldn't last a day with all that villainy and treachery
and not heroically he dies like a punk
so if someone who never saw star wars was going to watch the entire series how should they start watching it
i agree you definately have to spend a little time and work it out
so do i and i hear he'd like to be in an obi-wan movie if they make it
i knew hans solo was going to die harrison ford was getting too old
oh cool were you into that one
poor little piggy
no i actually have only seen one of the movies
i mean it's a valid question
he does but as an adolescent he drones on about how much he hates sand
who is your favorite character
do you think luke will turn into a sith in the new star wars
i guess in the future incest is not frowned upon
yeah nobody even saw that coming
who are they getting
i told you the dark side clouds his vision he can no longer get a clear vision of what is going to happen
what was he supposed to do say hey i have a bad feeling about all this be extra careful that's too vague it wouldn't have done any good
they are ewoks
i think that's because the filmmakers take the time to explore the characters in the first film they were more like archetypes
the other character study is leia coming to terms that she is falling in love with a scoundrel she's so frustrated at herself
han solo doesn't evolve that much in empire - his big evolution came in star wars when he came down on the side of the rebels
well a tractor beam could be very large so it wouldn't fit on a small ship like the t-47 airspeeders that were used in the battle of hoth
no there is much more
they have an amazing rapport that's for sure poor chewie he never got his medal
i enjoyed it a lot but i was a little confused about how it really connected with the other movies
wow that's my favorite movie as well
he had to have learned from yoda how to keep his mind busy
if they had to sure but hopefully nothing ever happens to james earl jones
did you like anything about darth vader in the prequal movies
so the jedi had their own style of martial arts
of the three prequals the phantom menace was the best the 2nd one was boring and the last one felt rushed
did you think attack of the clones was out of place
i think he knows a purpose but might be too disillusioned to chase it
r2-d2 is my younger cousin's favorite character in the entire film series
oh that's right and men always talk about how great she looks in that gold bikini in return of the jedi but
what's your favourite aspect of the star wars franchise
it was really hard i figured he'd get rescued but i wasn't sure how
frank oz i believe
that's what i love about rogue one it takes its time to introduce the characters to the audience
i keep hearing people say kylo ren is going to turn good
it was down to two trios at the end and then lucas picked the three we all know and love
rey i remember rey from the force awakens
i love the original trilogy best i grew up watching a new hope and waiting for the others to come out
prolly out of drugs
he was just sort of boring before the original trilogy
exactly
oh i agree
yeah i want to watch a star wars movie with him in it
oh man that is such a hard question i loved all three
yes that melody is williams at his best so sweeping and orchestral and emotionally evocative
the newest crazy theory is that supreme leader snoke is actually ezra from the star wars rebels series
it reminds me of the human condition
yeah all the lightning bolts out of his hands
no i did not did you
possibly what made you think of that
that's what it means exactly the character development is a very impoirtant part of making a movie
my favorite was han solo what about you
what is your opinion about chewbacca
not a bad choice for someone who doesn't know much
yeah i thought she was kind of annoying at first
moisture vaporators
i guess that's why they needed c3-po
yeah but i don't know that this bears much scrutiny
yeah he really didn't do much even after queen amidalia got in the senate
8
i like what they have done with all of the storm troopers too they aren't just one kind like in attack of the clones
i'd have to go with the battle of scarif more variety of vehicles and comabt types
do you think that yoda will make an appearance in the last jedi
no really i prefer the first trilogy that started in the 70's
yes of course i've probably seen more of them than not
don't you also have a star wars key chain
have you seen the original star wars movie
cliche but a good enough choice
really i had no idea that makes sense though i can see how it gave it a more personable feel
not sure but i hope it doesnt focus around leia's death
yeah i like the fight stuff but the big thing for me is to find out what happened to make luke skywalker walk away from everything
i guess i went in knowing everyone might die but
have you seen all of them
isn't that kind of the point of him why do we need to know any of that
do you think rey will become a great fighter
like losing family members and whatnot
sure i love that movie
it is do you think it'll be good
one of my favorite scenes is when hans cuts open that animal and stuffs luke into it to keep them alive
do you mean the millennium falcon
i agree while i have enjoyed some of the new ones i like the original three star wars movies the most
did you predict han and leia having a child
that would be awesome can't wait for that
what thing
those are both problems i've also heard and agree with i also felt qui-gon was killed pretty anti-climatically
actually i loved the story in the characters
i also like the celebration music at the end
probably the all terrain armored transport
did you like rogue one
well mine would have to be the fight over the sarlacc pit in return of the jedi
look we'll just agree to disagree on this what role do you see him playing in the next few movies
that's kind of cynical don't you think
you mean because of a group of rebels going rogue or radical
obi wan cultivated that persona when he brought luke to his aunt and uncle
where did his sister end up at
that must have been uncomfortable
who is your favorite actress from the star wars movies
yeah and her storyline is so compelling
i am an analytical individual i like to analyze things
the other bits of the soundtrack are great too it always makes me so nostalgic
me too that added a lot for me
but you think he's a tragic character
oh you mean like it's supposed to be showing some sort of internal struggle or like an actor acting like he's acting
the trailer was kind of sad though
so what is your opinion of the movie suicide squad
yes that was graphic for my taste
no but the brought back jones
that was pretty good yeah
yes and he's cute too especially when he was running in the cage ball
hey man what's your favorite chuck norris movie
that is true
i thought it was great
samuel l jackson
do you know where they shot those scenes
yep that's the one completely ridiculous
yes they are good
yeah i liked the killer hard boiled faceoff hard target there's just so many cool scenes in each of them
yeah that's awesome oh and mission impossible 2 was good although i'm told cruise interfered a lot with the final cut of the film
yes those are great scenes
what one
why is that
that's getting up there a bit
what role does dafoe play
no part 1 is more horrorsuspense and part 2 is more action
he just does too much now
yes this was still when the cold war was up and running
isn't thats what makes a good movie
i read in september
he was a cooky character
yea he is so good at martial arts
hi
what did you think of the movie
what action movie has the best bank heist scene
what did you think of the diner scene
yeah that was there first scene together in any movie correct
best little techy in the business
do you like action movies
are you serious right now
the soundtrack for this action movies was one of the better ones for sure
i saw the avengers civil war
all set at christmas time an action christmas movie
hey what was the movie where the guy went on a rampage after his dog got killed
personally i'd recommend wonder woman
there were quite a bit of memorable scenes in that movie
hong kong action flicks are the best
yes i did i couldn't believe that the captain and iron man fought each other
it had tom hanks and leonardo dicaprico
i have never seen that one
yes
exactly that one angelina jolie was great in it
i will never forget that so long as i live
well for new ones i would say logan
snatch was one
the new mad max fury road
are you a fan of kurt russel
do you like action movies
what's the verdict
do you think that is his best film
i like clint eastwood did you ever see gran torino
i mean it should be simple
yea but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on ben afflecks characters tv
are you going to watch the transformer last knight
the one in the airport
yep that's the one
why do you say that
i like old action movies as well
yeah love action movies
yes richard donner
who plays his wife
i just saw it last week
yeah and that show
yep all the rambo movies had lots of guns and a bit of love too
there is a movie called shaolin soccer that might be what you are looking for
yes i actually saw it with my dad when it came out in theaters
that's my favorite too probably one of the greatest chases in history period
are you going to see king arthur
what was the movie about
why is that
that's easy commando
yeah same here
have you seen the movie karate kill
yea the fighting was amazing
like they are said to be better than they really are
i really liked captain america civil war because of that
i love those movies but why are they your favorites
oh yeah cameron diaz she's really developed as an actress since her debut in the mask
i did think in the belko experiment that the tags in their heads were kind of stupid
whoa sounds like a genre clash you don't usually get guns and magic in the same movie
and she said what is that and he thought she meant his uh member
i like groot a lot i think its so funny
what is your favorite movie
i love felicity jones she is a talented actress
they remade that one in the 1990s
what is that
did you like the live-action titans and how they looked
are there a lot of good scares in that one
i did have some trouble with the tone changes parts are very happy and parts are very depressing
i went to go see the guardians of the galaxy 2 movie last week it was so good
i think the universe its in is right
lots of extreme action that's just sort of believable because maybe we really do have spies that advanced
oh i believe it could be possible they just have to train an insane amount
yeah i got stuff going what do you care
i think that's supposed to be an epic scene for this movie sort of like russian roulette only with poison
thats ok im actually fine with whatever you choose
al pacino is michael corleone in both movies he's probably the main guy but brando plays his father as an old man and deniro plays his father as a young man
that stood out a little to me too
i disagree the second one is much better with more thrilling adventures
well tom cruise and jake johnson are soldiers but they are a bit corrupted they like to steal antique artifacts
oh man i just saw inside out for the first time this weekend
yeah they didn't really enforce it until 1935
but i don't think that one was as good as the original
i remember it being okay
i agree but how about representation with women of color
hey have you seen any good movies lately im tryimg to go see something this weekend
yes i am pretty sure i have seen them all except the latest one they are a big hit with my husband
when he is at the dining table
i mean the other one the one with daniel craig as james bond
a year
have you seen drstrange yet
and what he was willing to do to get that skill back
what movies are coming out that you are looking forward to
well it just came out but wonder woman
oh yeah they need to keep coming out with these types of movies
i loved that too clark's such a great character what other comedies are among your favorites
sounds like it deserves an oscar though how was the acting
no charlie kaufman dude who did all that stuff 15 years ago adaptation being john malkovich eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
it's always fun to talk about a movie with someone else talking about it now reminded me of how much of a good time i had about it
yea i think they are doing it in the future
so the basic storyline
it's about a legend trying to stay at the top of his game amongst the new comers
they are way too cute
they are sort of one note
yes it made a lot of money and has become one of the staples of the horror genre
i am really excited to see it now i can't wait for the weekend so i can go to the movies
no that's not my kind of flick
today at 3pm i know what you mean i have been wanting to go see it for along time too
a good setting makes a movie much more enjoyable
for me it's beauty and the beast
who is in that movie
is it kind of like memento in that regard
and the teacher did you have a jerk teacher like him
shockingly its up there for me too
nope it was me and like two other couples
and you know what's cool the director pedro rodrigues has sorta based this movie on a saint
it was to die-for chris pratt is becoming one of my favorites
i'll maybe give it another shot but i'm going with martin scorcese for best director of all time
in fact i bet kids that are bullied would have loved a version centered around him
who is in that
if you like sci fi there is an older movie called the fifth element that is good
bruce willis hasn't done a lot of sci fi movies
that sounds interesting the photos aren't from the family though
yeah i like bad movies but only when they are unintentionally bad
yes it was quite interesting
yes they were great

ok let me go freshen up and i'll be on my way to yours
i'll have to look into it
why do you think that
yes he was the great terrence malick directed that and the haunting narrations and montages are usually his style i think sean penn took some inspiration from that for the last face
it is good but i am more of a fan of the classics such as a christmas story
the movie has a lot of his music in the movie
oh yeah i like some of that i also like modern stuff
yes please do
have you seen angel of darkness
no not at all
that russian fighter isn't a likeable person
do you have any idea what it's supposed to be about
neither have i honestly
great idea let's watch them together soon
i would buy them for my girls they like the minions
okay that could be interesting
my favorite actress is cameron diaz
i know what you mean dc finally got a movie right
i know they didn't want to do everything just like marvel but i think they needed to build each character with their own movie first
huh looks like sofia coppola has another movie out
that's crazy
are any of them from disney
i loved that movie so much what about patch adams
i thought inception was a great movie however shutter island was also a great one
what is your favorite movie genre
youre kidding me
take your pick of any movie that stars hulk hogan
i still use some of the lines in my everyday conversations sometimes
i watched the get out movie and it was good
that's pretty neat
molly ringwald emilio estavez judd nelson ally sheedy and some others
me either
my family and i really enjoyed it
i love when the grandpa runs out of the house because he thinks there's an earthquake
i know and i always forget that it was produced by disney
me too i really want to see the new beauty and the beast movie
i like it better than the first wonder woman
i can go with you let's try for sunday
yes that can solve some arguments quickly
matilda is a classic i used to love that one
becuase deadpool constantly wisecracks and even breaks the fourth wall to talk directly to the audience
i am a huge batman fan and i think in terms of film he is at the very top
never seen that one before is it any good
who is in it
whoppi goldburg and ray laiota
you hated it that much
no i'm not sure that they are allowed to have any xmen in marvel movies
i can't wait to see national treasure 3
everything he directs has a lot of intrigue in it
i think i saw it years ago i completely forgot about it
yea it seems like it could be it's supposed to be from steven spielberg's film
have you seen creed
yeah i bet they rely on a bunch of cheesy special effects
no i haven't even heard of that
i don't know i didn't see it i think it's online somewhere
it was pretty good
yes she can
no i haven't read it
somehow i don't doubt it
it wasn't that bad really
really i guess he is pretty good isn't he
the blues brothers is just all around good
that's why it's not a true story but a love story
have you heard about the new tupac movie
i don't know the name of the guy
i did notice that he looked a good bit like him
this movie will do that for you
i'll pick you up at 630 then as it starts at 715
yes plus the actors were amazing all the way around
yes i had to tell them it was a bad movie
yea i do get involved with the plot of movies that way
yeah everything wasn't bliss in the future
does keanu reeves play the lead in this movie
sure when is it out
i agree
really i loved it on her
the script was amazing in that movie
they kissed at the end but it's like does sarah know who chuck is yet
at least if they made a movie they could have wrapped up this strange twist in the first 10 minutes
indeed this one has an extremely high body count
what do you know about the movie the giver
i liked it i also liked mark wahlberg's movie called ted 2
no two completely different movies the witch in the wizard of oz brought dorothy to her castle against her will so the witch got what she deserved
so manygot to be sitting on the highway and the car catches on fire man makes me laugh now
i'm not not a fan whats on your mind
is it because you're single
the music was very good and i was glad to here familiar songs
i know i got worried after seeing it do you think he is going to die or something
have you watched his new movie solace
how do you know that
i think some are still alive still
where does the movie take place
nah i found it to be quite boring actually
yes i really enjoyed it
wow there is a lot going on in this film
oh come on i just mean how much i'm going to be moving around
i like the squirrel
most animals usually do that
ok i will
elizabeth banks she is so sweet it was a good role for her
i love the ending of the first one where they had the poison berries
i never told you but i had a secret crush on jeanine the secretary annie potts was the actress
i was having this debate with my cousin and he says spectacular now was such a superior movie with shailene woodley and miles teller
yeah they always have at least one animated one severl action movie and of course those horror movie as well
so i take he intervenes
that's no problem but it's weird in other ways as well
that's a nice viewing experience
yes your probably right but can you imagine how had it must be to get all your ideas out and have others understand it well enugh to act it out perfectly
of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine is one i remember
huh never heard of it
i am looking for a good movie series
that's such a tough question
what's your favorite david fincher movie
which back to the future movie do you like best
yeah it probably traumatized you
exactly the case she convinces her husband to try to help out as many of the local towns folk who are mostly jewish to escape the nazi regime
so these cars overtake the older ones
ok go on
yes i just watched the pleasure garden
well sort of but it's still hitchcock
what is your favorite action movie
yea in fast n furious he plays a big buff cop that nobody can beat
yea he really was but again big tough guy that nobody can beat
have you seen the movie moana
which version of miracle on 34th street do you like the best
was it good
sounds like my kind of movie jamie is a cutie too
how did you like john candy in that
she actually plays a big role later on i want spoil things but she has a rapid character change
the jerk i have never seen that
have you watched patriot's day
there definitely is a lot to keep track of
it just didn't seem worth the hype
how did you feel about chris pratt waking jennifer lawrence up
how about his movieas good as it gets
i like these types of movies they remind me of quentin tarantino movies
the soundtrack was amazing has the rock sung before
i mean steel magnolias is a fun movie
there were a lot of famous actors in that movie
do you think the prestige or the illusionist is a better movie
like it's all about the trick
yes in my film analysis class
oh yes you have mike myers eddie murphy cameron diaz cody cameron chris miller etc
do you have all of those
do you know what is playing
i research old japanese movies
hmmm i'm not really sure
it's really sweet it's about a young witch who goes out into the world to come of age it's really lovely
me too i know i'll wind up seeing it either way
yes i had watched a documentary about that and noticed that they made sure to closely match the characters to the real people
yea hugh jackman and ryan reynolds in the same movie would be epic
so many freak accidents
yeah everyone was getting decapitated
i bet it's bad let me know how it is so i can decide if i want to watch it or not
i disagree i think that his abusive attitude was necessary in order to weed out those who couldn't make the cut
well now that you put it that way i can see what you mean
he actually translates well to the animated screen
that could have been because she was pregnant and her hormones were raging
what is so scary aboutn him
he sure is i love him in just about anything
don't you think any of the movie is good
haha i love that quote for us to live any other way was nuts but man there was no movie like it a the time it set the new standard for mob pictures for crime pictures
yep it does i want to go visit that place
but at the same time the other humans looked at him as an outcast
several times i really liked it she's a good actress
you are going to love john wick 2 i didn't think it would be as good as the first one but it was
yes it is very strange
i do think gal gadot's scenes in batman vs superman were the best things about that movie
so you want to watch it this weekend
hahathat's for sure
the amazing jean reno and depardieu
what do you mean supposedly
oh so he was telling the viewers it was their responsiblity to order responsibly
it was in the end a lot of people credit it with saving the production
same it was honestly one of the best movies i've seen in a long time
one scene that comes to mind is where steven has a nightmare of the cable guy breaking into his apartment and attacking him he essentially looks like a demon with glowing eyes
just looking at all the new movies coming out these next few years are going to be awesome
but the actors in spiderman are not as refined
hmm i would have to go with the matrix you
oh wow that's really cool who are the main stars
i think romance movies are underrated
the lead actor is a young guy but so smart it is fun to watch too
do you like the lord of the rings films
i cried when frodo had to get on the boat
no i saw it was on netflix should i watch it
what other good pirate movies are there though
it was about the pirate long john silver
i really like documentaries
city of ghosts
i hate how some companies milk movies
i do not know
oh right i also liked all of the different characters she dorothy met on the yellow brick road
yeah knocked up is a classic
at least the funniest pussy galour
actually no it uses a lot more computer generated effects instead
when did it come out
they are movies that take place in ancient greece or rome
i loved the scene in the beginning of the film with brad pitt's character achilles facing off against that huge warrior
which one would you say is your favorite
that's a tough question because there are so many i like i would have to say clueless
it kind of ruins the genre
have you seen guardians of the galaxy
you bet it is hilarious
don't you get tired of fart jokes
yep just goes to show how opinions can change over the years
i think that king triton was too hard on ariel and thats why she was more rebelious to find a way to the surface
it is and isn't still coming of age and focus on a teen
while i'm sick of the song first time i saw it the scene was good when else unleashed her powers
i know that was good how it wasn't lets run off and marry someone we just met
wasn't he the director of the terminator movies
i read something about that disney initially set the budget for 250 million but a few problems happened on set which racked it up
which one's that
it depends but yeah also steve carell is the voice of the main character
sure let's go tomorrow night
i think i heard this one was about him persuing some sort of trident right
never take anything seriously in deadpool
i know and jesse eisenburg was terrible as lex
i hate movies where they force people to interact with a clearly cgi character who isn't there
it's amazing how they can create something that seems so real
my family recently signed up for amazon prime so we have been enjoy the selection of movies
it is nice when that happens and the adults don't get bored watching a movie for kids
no he hadn't convinced me in any of his previous performances
and also a lot of other disney movies like up
what is your favorite scene
i liked how they took some time to get out into no man's land and clean up and take the dead
so who's turn is it tonight who is in control of the remote
yes the bottom line is money
and you don't think jackson deserves some of the blame for that
the real singer's name was marni nixon they used her in a lot of musicals
i also like the cowboys but it is really sad
oliver stone did a great job directing that
i'm intrigued
it really did
i liked it too it was original at least
okay i will be ready

i really liked him in the patriot and we were soldier as well
yes they had no idea when or if he was coming back she couldn't just continue to put her life on hold
i have seen that one many times maybe i will watch another kubrick movie
yeah that's more what i'm talking about it doesn't seem like it happens often though

wow sounds like its pretty intense
yes there were very intelligent women who helped nasa octavia spencer portrayed one of these women
i don't know if i ever actually saw that whole movie
i like them though the movies are easier to follow peter jackson did a great job
elijah wood orlando bloom viggo mortensen liv tyler cate blanchett
it was so good it had been a while since i had seen a movie with him
it is you know i read a strange fact about tom hanks a couple of weeks ago on twitter
the one starring gol gaddot
i'll bring that movie and one more that is newer
fred is elegant and still manly while kelly is like a truck driver
yeah i've had a really hard time finding a good one
oh doesn't sound like there is much in there to make a movie
great he is the 7th ranger with the sun power right
i like his portion in 4 rooms too
yea it was really lucky and a lot of hardwork on his part
true have you seen any of gillian flynn's other movies
do you mean arrival
really how come
but that is just an excuse
the sequels to the movies were good too
liked it did you
all of the amazons were athletes i heard it makes a difference
oh yeah what was it
speaking of actors i heard there were cameos by actors from the original
yep but the ants eventually end up fighting back
i love the xmen series
have you seen the movie ice age it is a movie about three animals trying to make it to safety because were they live the ice is melting
well i like romance and comedy maybe some drama
yes it was released in the 60s but as you say it stands up to the test of time
i heard about that but never saw it - it was quite controversial
what was your favorite movie
my youngest is 7 and the other is 10
both in the air and on the ground
i heard there's a sequel coming out
monty python and the holy grail best comic book movie
yeahis it a comedy
i really enjoyed watching her play elinor kate winslet was good too
my favorite has to be anchorman
i will check it out
she sure is a cutie i liked the sequal to monsters inc where they go to college
i have they're cute but not my favorite
that's another great movie if you liked that you will love casino
you should i mean if you don't like it at least you didn't pay anything extra if you stream it from netflix
seriously
last one but it's a joke what subtitle should now you see me ii have had
no no no it's all cheesy and kind of takes you out of it
did you see all of them when they came out
what did you like about it hate about it
haha nah i didn't really like the original wicker man either i thought it was too slow and dull
i really like rob zombie's halloween i honestly thought the originals were kinda drab especially in comparison
i don't know about that the original is dated but it is a classic
at the theater how was that possible
you might like mama mia then
that would be a whole other night
eddie has acted to many movies that i have lose count of so even if he's not acting anymore which i doubt then he's pay his due
i loved her character of alex
thinking of the joker specifically what do you think was his best scene in that movie
yea i saw it too thoughts
the acting was really good
did you see wonder woman
i love his use of lighting that's his hallmark
me tooand having high expectations made me disappointed
you might like it though everyone else seemed to
i guess he's retired he and his wife rhea perlman are somewhere relaxing that's for sure
did dc stop when green lantern failed
but this movie was so emotional
what is your favorite animated film
i'm going to have to check that out i thought finding nemo was amazing
i remember that scene it was pretty cheesy
yes and a bunch of other great actors
not that i can think of i hate being scared
who did you think played superman the best
wow sounds cool what is it about
dang that is intense
me too he is such a great actor
yes do you prefer to see them in the theater or at home
she is and so is edward just saying i find brad standing out the most here
you should i am sure that you will all enjoy it
well there's jiro dreams of sushi
well bill murray was perfect in that role for one thing
and even crazier to think that the series is more popular than ever thanks to movies like logan and deadpool
i must be the only person who has never seen it then
musicals are not my type either but they are pretty good when disney has a hand in them
i don't usually like cartoons
yea she has a lot of famous actors her family including lionel barrymore
no i dont know what you mean
who directs it
men at work is the only one that i can think of it definitely wasn't the best film
yes he did the last big hit that i remember him starring in was young guns
so like war of the worlds
worst movie evergo
haha i should have remembered that he also did the one set in china right
exactly the only memorable scene was when he had to say bye to his wife
same closest we got was when he was in the city after destroying the tea in or whatever
yeah he did he wrote and directed this movie
yeah he does their is one called 4321
it was a great movie but i thought that denzel washington had the better performance
well that was part of the plot to build into the new one
there are some really good lines in there that is for certain
no not really
oh yes and an alien 3 and 4 i think of course there was predator vs alien
haha sounds funny
that was a good scene
i could not believe how much she threw herself around she is very physical in that role
it was a brilliant script the actors did a great job giving fans that moment
i have not
i never had the chance to watch that movie before
ok i appreciate your recomendation
i thought that one was the worst of the indiana jones movies
he is good in all of his movies
so the kids watch the trial that their father is in defending this black man of rape
which one was it do you remember
yes but they all had a bit of comedy as well
okay
off a cliff
that is interesting planet of the apes and 2001 both had apes in it
i have
that movie was good about introducing a new fairy though
i'm sure that had a large effect on the movie
oh yes i have seen almost all of them they are all great movies
whats good my man
yes i have i just watched guardians of the galaxy vol 2
probably because they're simply not very good movies
i mean is that mostly the case
yes i do like them which one is your favorite
of course our favorite is shaun of the dead
mine too
whatever happened to the main actor
yes i loved most of them
yes that one
the lyrics are so much more hilarious
they were interesting but unfortunately you're correct that they weren't always so successful
so have you seen any good movies lately in the theaters
oh which ones
what was the most disgusting movie you've ever seen
i want to it's gotten pretty good reviews
i've seen the trailer once or twice somewhere and it looked interesting
it is deeper i think but that one is great
that's not to say he doesn't have a heart but he's also ruthless
i have how did you like it
yes you're right the movie follows his life pretty closely
don't you wish you had the spirit of bagger vance
they finally figure out what to do and just about get killed trying to do it
i didn't see that one
me too i loved all the characters
sure what sort of movies do you like
how is the acting
yeah it's weird that it became such a cult classic but i love it what else is so quotable
but prior to that in 1878 there was a short film of a horse in motion
well they have hugh jackman patrick stewart boyd holbrook and richard grant as a few in the movie
i loved the part when gru blew up the carnival game to win her the unicorn
the director is wes craven
isn't that the one with nicholas cage
i know but still
yeah i love when actors work on multiple projects together
with my kids i have 5 daughters
i think he played in a show called queer as folk years ago
the good the bad and the ugly
yes
he is a great director
i can watch it with you
that one is good do you like robert downey jr
would you agree that they are some of the best super hero movies
i know it was her daughter
i agree
a lot of the time i will sit through his movies and he'll sit through mine
what's your favorite musical comedy movie
was that the only difference between the movie and the actual mission
the movies are too loaded and they have great visual effects but sometimes its too much
well first of all it has a lots of great muscle cars
oh wait it's a gangsterheist movie
what decade was his best
oh he's that sherlock holmes guy right
is that movie foreign
it's about a mercenary who is kind of lonely and doesn't know how to live well
then i am sure i haven't seen it
that movie has so many good scenes in it
mischance barton was in it right
yes i believe the doll maker and his wife invite a few nuns and some young girls from the orphanage to live with them
who was in it
which mummy did you prefer
no but i hear it's great in 3d are you planning to watch it that wy
didn't they rename that one to jigsaw
keira knightley was in the last one too
who is your favorite actor
nah not at all
have you ever seen dark city
no but i've heard of it who is in it again
what's it about
that's a nice cast
they went through some much especially when the kitty gets sucked into the river that was awful
no i think 3 takes the cake
number 2 is good but yeah doesn't beat 1 or 3
pretty cool movie
django that is another golden flick
what did you think of moonlight that won the academy award for best picture
right that was unreal i must say the la la land crew was very gracious about turning over the award
yeah it's actually really impressive how he makes them work
who is the director
that is how i have seen most new movies since i do not go to theaters much
adam sandler is really at his best in this film
it is the perfect mix in one movie
i thought so it had a great plot and cast
my wife won't watch those movies with me - she is afraid of jumping monkeys
who was your favorite superhero in it
oh i always like really good visual effects in movie
i am kind of interested in conspiracy theories so i really liked those films
good
it had kurt russell right
the movie was definitely different but overall good
oh it was tom hanks was main character how could you go wrong
why is that
i think that if you do than you can get an idea of how the character evolves
yeah this movie did a lot of things differently
i really like the black cauldron
that's kind of deep in 7 pounds the main character is thinking the same
sounds like a good movie i will have watch it soon
no i have not what was it like
do you like dirty dancing
it was a book first written by arthur golden
a very young girl whose family sells her to be a geisha
nope i never got to it i did watch a couple other nominated movies though
it also has kevin costner in it right
both and the sequel to 2004 punisher warzone
you might be right there can you think of any more shoot'em ups
sandra bullock
because their movies
then what do you mean
really i am always afraid to see those types of movies
point taken are there any other action movies you would recommend
did you ever see him in elysium
any good movies you've seen lately
that's exactly why i watched it
right
where are you going with this
very funny but we've talked about some recent movies
that doesn't sound very exciting
no way reeves was a classic superman
and finally can bend no more
topol was amazing as tevye
we can go together this friday if you want to
didn't he win an oscar for that role
about life on mars it was well directed and cool special effects
what was the worst movie for you of last year
actually i was going to ask if you've seen both the original and the remake
typical
it was a really great movie but it wasn't truly ground breaking and it didn't make any social or political statements that usually leads to a best picture nomination
yup that's the one
yeah it was a pretty awesome movie
so it would seem
oh that does sound great
george lucas puts together some awesome movies
hey there
he was not as insane enough in how he portrayed him
no i don't go for subtitled movies
ok here's a question for you--what is your favorite movie of all time
yes that was a good one
the trailers make it look real good
yes i saw it in the theater it wasn't perfect but i would watch another one
hey
do you have the trailer on your phone
how is the cinematography
i loved the craft it made me want to be a witch and cast spells
what
not really
no not really it's an intense friendship but an intense female friendship being perceived as being romantic love by others does play a part in the plot
i think it is going to be different monsters
didn't that movie come out a while ago
do you have any favorite kid shows you can tolerate as an adult
yep
let's make a deal then we will see the final star wars movie in the new trilogy in imax
isn't chris pratt in that movie
everything seems like it's becoming a cinematic universe thing now
i wonder if any big stars are in it
so what's your take on the whole time travel genre of movies i have seen a fees advertised lately
the old one or the semi newer movie
i think they have reincarnated that movie too many times
it is really good do you want me to tell you about it
yes he was good in those
i love it i own it on blue-ray
yeah that is it
anyway in chapter 3 some information starts to be revealed you said you're going to see it so i do not want to spoil it
star wars
he likes money and he can't make good movies anymore
oh come on he isn't that bad
eh not one of disney's most interesting i'm kind of trying of the chosen one trope
jason sudeikis was also in colossal
the fact that you can go up to anyone and say no i am your father and have them immediately catch the reference that says so much
no i have never seen that one before what is it about
this movie would be perfect for her then the singing is great and the songs are really cute
yeah so i can wait a couple months for it to come on demand
hello
the singing and dancing was so great
oh that sounds great just let me know what day
its a shame the 90s had some great films
i love the one with the russian can't keep track of which numbered movies they are but that was great
what else should i see
oh my that sounds entertaining what did you think
tell me if you see it
this could be a turning point for me i suppose
would you say you liked weekend at bernie's
it was pretty intense it was interesting though too it made me feel bad for some of the girl's family actually
oh yeah i didn't realize that was his i thought that was a clint eastwood flick
yeah not bad
it's just an infectiously good movie great vibes
i agree and the script is so smartly and cleverly written with its racial commentary
so true blazing saddles and young frankenstein come up all the time and rightly so but silent movie definitely gets short shrift
i have seen it he goes to hawaii right
isn't he i always like him but in interstellar he really got me
you don't plan on seeing the movie if i told you it would spoil things
what is your favorite action movie
do you have a favorite one
seth macfarlane is funny
you won't be sorry
didn't kill bill follow a similar format- i think i know what you are talking about
i think i saw a commercial with him- he is getting old
it does actually i haven't seen it
that's the idea yes
do you watch any foreign films
his acting style suits tony stark well
which one
it is really fun and a little different then the first one
just a western like the wild bunch the magnificent seventhe treasure of the sierra madre or high noon you mean
it sounds like you like movies with really happy endings
i hope they don't mess it up
yea that one was pretty good too
well at least you thought it was enjoyable
a sign of a great actor
parts were fictional parts of it could be real
oh so then hollywood could just make blockbuster versions of franchises they know for a fact there are already a lots of fans for
did you see there is a new pirates coming out
that's hard to say i've liked so many of them but if i had to pick i'd say blade runner
disney i thought we were talking about marvel
the hit man's mom dies and his girlfriend gets killed
didn't really get into that much
trying to keep us stupid and wanting to be with their kind like there is something wrong with us being with our own kind
i think he was good in i am legend
is baby groot in it
it was cute
i like the thrills and scares
that would be charlie hunnam and jude law
did they have a queen in it
me too such a long movie
i take my kids only once a month we tend to see family comedies more than animated movies
i kind of want to see the captain underpants one too
yes where have you been
the first one hard john cena in it didn't it
i did yes did you like it
i think it's both it sets us up to expect certain things like a threat and then provides a twist on that threat
nicolas cage movies in general have taken a turn for the unintentionally funny lately
indeed i can watch nicolas cage overact a role for days it's so enjoyable
haha same here there are so many memorable quotes
i like how when they made beerfest they all had completely different characters
they are so funny in all the jay and silent bob movies i especially like when bob can't see the 3d picture
i like french movies mostly myself
i think i can recall one not sure the exact name though
there or anywhere really netflix hulu etc
yea me too vera farmiga is good too
being an actor has its ups and downs
it was funny watching the rock be a geeky guy
groot and drax were my favorite characters
well there are some scenes in which i felt that there are glitch around his wrists when he plays the piano i think
it is at one point the kids pay for them to go on vacation they end up in a noisy hotel
have you seen the new remake with melissa mccarthy
she really was she brought belle to live and it gave me more understanding for her falling in love
i wonder if this movie going to be about them just as kids or are they going to grow up into adults like the original it
suprisingly most of the franchise movies are the same over and over again that's why i was not interested at first
yes that was great i like fantasy ad sci fiction so i usually hit all of those as soon as they come out
it has a 63 out of 10 on imdb
i like dramas a lot period dramas
hi nancy i wanted to ask if you wanted to go to the movies
yes it was a lot better than i thought it would be
i think he was a bit crazy
i like that movie
i like imdb better
oh who else was in that one
yeah it will definitely be different
what's your favorite 'lord of the rings' movie
yeh and every scene to be so uniquely crafted you will so into it
there was a decent story and lots of action
my money is on the earth people but i hope i'm surprised with an antagonist that is completely different
there was a revival house downtown it's such a great movie to see in the theater you know
what's that about
but what's the plot
so i just gave up on it too early
i know that's why i was hoping this one would be as good but it wasn't
is that the newest x men movie
i thought the actors were both from the east coast
true did you see snakes on a plane
i disagree if you look at it from the spoof angle
it was a great movie and a great book did you know that's where she met her fiance liam hemsworth
i guess it wasn't too long
yeah the avengers had scarlett johannsen running around in a leather suit she couldn't breath in and heels
well if its that good yeah i will come over later and watch it
honestly i don't think it was scary or gory in that way but they probably won't understand a lot that is going on it may be a bit too complex for a younger kid
not yet i knew it came out the other week so i have just been working too much as usual
i liked them fine but i probably wouldn't have minded someone else
nope they call the phone and the person who answers instructs them to head to clinton a nearby small town where he'll meet them
like what what are some good ones
they said he looked authentic so they kept him alive to make their story of being random travelers who didn't know each other more believable
true but so many people died in his quest
have you seen the latest fast and furious movie
its great on a big screen
you're right and themyscira looks so amazing i wish it were real
so did you see the new beauty and the best movie with emma watson
who was the director
i agree the apes lions elephants all of the animals of africa were so beautifully displayed in this movie
what about the dentist
i can put on your favorite
i could see how that realism could bring you into the story
no you know what's crazy is when you go back and look at those movies how open disney was with negative portrayals of things
yeah i agree that they may have better graphics but i like harrison ford
oh that's nice i didn't really like that movie though
i see and what else
awesome i got food
yes he is and good looking too
i think it was so funny
with meryl streep and anne hathaway
why is that a favorite
nooo
come on you should know this
any preference on the movies or genre
his other films were not as thoughtful to me
where dazed dealt with high school and this one deals with college
you mean that one animation movie
the message in the movie was great
i forgot peter boyle was in it
how come
like sausage party
i forget about that one
to some extent but i'm impressed by groot because he doesn't really even talk
i still can't believe that groot sacrificed himself in the first movie to save the others
yes but it felt a bit like a b movie to me
i'm currently watching waterworld laying on the couch
i enjoyed the plot did you know ludacris was in it too
are you a fan of marvel movies
really i like the ones with tobey maguire that sam raimi did
oh wait i think i remember this one is bradley cooper in it
okay it wasn't horrible
i know frasier did such a swell job on the other ones
those were really great films
vision was weak
what ones
how though
what is your favorite thing about them
i always laugh at the one who says his name is bob
i really liked it i watched it with my best girl friends and we all felt so happy at the end how about you
i agree he was great but did his character borden have a twin or did he clone himself
sure is
i still liked him but not as much as in the dark night
they may i think they would like the dogs and adventure
i like the way in the captain movies bucky came into play
oh my yes they're the best
okay i'll watch it tonight
what is the movie about
not your typical villian
i do too
absolutely and to answer your question i have seen it several times and it's one of my favourites
i don't know the story line wasn't really good and i couldn't get into it

yes that one also had a really strong message about environmental degradation
thanks for helping me with this
i was really excited to see a live action harley quinn
yes i like titanic the most i've watched it over 15 times
i like the actors and like that is based on a true story
i'm more of a philosophical movie kind of person
i know originally it was only supposed to be a trilogy and then it changed to have five movies in the series instead
it opened a window for people to see and understand what was going on
he was kind of goofy in that one too which is kind of how he is seen by people
i was watching the commercial for the new despicable me movie the other day
what was the music
i really liked that one although i don't think the sequel was that good
gandalf mckellen did that part so well
it was just rose's chest right
i know there have been a few different actors that played bond
i enjoy seeing the way people support each other like family and friends do in reality
it was science fiction but it felt like more
se7en
the head scene
yeah that sounds about right
i see
oh is that the one with the rock
yep but even though it was a biography it had comedy and a heart it's too bad andy kaufman didn't become a movie star
i loved that gene kelly played a part in it
i was going to see if you were interested at all
i hope so speaking of edgar wright have you seen baby driver yet
of course i had been planning on seeing that this weekend
it is one of ridley scotts best movies
you will enjoy the movie
nothing in patticular why
i want to experience something strange and new not the same old stuff
exactly they may be aliens except for peter quill but they're funny and flawed it's easy to understand them
you'll like this then dick van dyke has a role
yeah she was also in a movie with bradley cooper
oh yeah
it was fun some of the songs were enjoyable too
have you noticed they are finally making more movies with diversity
i didn't get to see that one yet
yeah i'll admit there is a bit of an over satuaration in the majority of films out now
great i love movies
i haven't seen that one yet
oh i've heard of that one i think
yeah tom hiddleston is a super cool ex- cia guy
tell me the plot and i'll see if i know what it was
it was a modernized version of don quixote by cervantes
it was cool cause it was set in the 70's and it was a 90's movie
do you like animated movies or are they just for kids
i agree you should check these movies out
have you ever seen any zombie movies
well i'm not they felt really tacked on and honestly laughable
i want to see it
yes thats right de niro is a great actor
well it's an amazing movie even without a connection like that
who was the guy that robbed him in the beginning
i wish they would make a luke cage movie
yeah those dudes were old then but this new vampire takes it out of the dracula realm
oh hey i saw that eraserhead movie you mentioned
any favorites for you
bone tomahawk have you seen it
i think i might have seen that
oh no thanks i'm not into john wayne movies
breaking bad
okay so what's going on
that would be easy
that's way too young
well what's in theaters now
i'm gonna watch king kong first
that's true what's your favorite tarantino film
that movie was awesome but i don't ever remember it being in the theaters
no i have never seen any of the other ones either how many are there
not really my dad took me to the theater when i was a kid to see cinderella and i fell asleep
no
i hate you
what are your thoughts on the new mummy movie
yes i think she was
what do you mean
the kid blames himself and his uncle lets him
my niece is staying with us this weekend and i need to come up with some movies she can watch
it's about a rescued dolphin that needs an artificial tale
yes
it has some type of coolness to it
yes she is really talented
speaking of that is another one every one should watch
that one really changed the way western people see japanese films
remember glinda the good witch
i hope they live up to the humor in the first one
me neither it seems like horror for a lot of the trailer
did you know richard o'brien was living as an unemployed actor in london during the early 1970s and wrote the movie just to stay busy
it's mostly because marvel has done a great job of making me care
i would maybe just talk to her about it beforehand so she's prepared
i love the fire swamp with the rous's what about you
how about the world's end
what about wonder woman
the last movie i saw was lego batman


i heard disney was doing a peter pan movie as well
its actually called the fate of furious
yeah that did a pretty of it
what do you think was the best film of last year
my favorite ones are all the dc hero movies
the superman movies have pretty much ruined that franchise also
yep that's the sign of good writing and how about tom cruise
it was so good you won't be sorry
it's aggravating i wish the movies were either better or worse
yeah but i missed some of the cheesiness of the older movies
i don't know if it was as well done though
mostly comedies i also like suspense and horror
that would depend of the genre
have you seen any good movies lately
in general yes they seem to be better
i didn't know that i love chris pratt he is the reason i sit through it
can't wait to watch it with you you're gonna love it
have you seen that movie the switch
it was definatelyh a modern look into parenting and commented on older parents
i am not sure there has been talk that it will not center around a theme park at all
i like the sherlock holmes ones he did
what about lesser known movies casablanca citizen kane and gone with the wind are so overplayed
it seems there's always a brat in these movies
which movie by denzel washington have you watched more than once
nothing really supernatural it is more of how the mind gets played with
are there any well know actors in it
i know that jude law and the guy from vikings is in it
i think we will like it
3 times why
how did you like it
yes but i didn't think it was as good as the tv show episodes

well she has won the best actress oscar twice and been nominated for many more
yeah it was kind of like ant-man pretty good but nothing special
yeah definitely
yes i really thought that was a good film what others have you seen recently
yeah i agree he had a good run in the beginning
is it that good
it's certainly in the realm because warner bros wants him for the white akira movie
yes it was a great movie what kinds of movies do you like
which is your favorite avenger
i love the way robert downy jr plays iron man
yeah i know the movie is hilarious
you know the title
it was so good in real life like that i enjoyed it
a little bit the actor falls from a 10 story building lands on a car and walks away with a few scratches
okay okay i have seen some exaggerated scenes but they still get my adrenaline pumping

have you ever watched the movie lonesome dove

that was a great scene spider-man and ant man added a lot of humor
so what would back to the future 4 be about
1995
which summer movie are you looking forward to the most
i did not it was too pushed and kind of silly i am into the avengers though
yes it was mark wahlberg is such a good actor i can't believe how closely the movie followed the actual events
also a great movie how did you like ferrell in talladaga nights
so what do you think about the end do you think he actually did all those things
that's funny i like that soundtrack too but not the movie so much
yes it's very good i like daniel craig
i still think sean connery is the best bond for the time but daniel craig is really good
me too but man he was born to play james bond lol
it was made in the early 1940's
i've always wanted to act sure
yes i thought it was excellent
probably the hunger games series
i wonder when the horror movies began
no it's not and here i'm looking up how we define a horror movie see as long as visual literary artistic expression existed horrifying images texts and depictions existed
that sounds really cool i'm going to watch that soon which movie is your favorite
and you knew that the flashback at the beginning didn't actually take place until after the movie
did you see the last one with the main cast
oh
it's an amazing swedish vampire movie
with eddie murphy of course they were funny reminded me of flubber
how about your favorite actresses
what is it like
what tye of movies do you like
what did you think of the twilight series
yea it looked really pretty i hated the sparkle scene
i really liked the end scene with yondu and peter
if you want to see it i would wait until it's on hbo or something
yeah wasn't crazy about it i like sandy wexler much better
i've loved it since i was a kid and it still completely holds up to this day
i guess i would go with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
that sounds great
yes i heard it is gonna be amazing did you ever see some of his older movies
i lived that one my favorite is cry baby ever seen it
what about that movie why him
oh that was great too showcased his talents
man that looked really good
what's the verdict
i was surprised to see sylvester stallone
so what did you think about it
what kind of name is qui gon chin
no it really is scary you have to watch it so anyway the kid's parents die and the tall man takes them and then he goes after the kid's older brother
gun crazy i love that movie- that's one of my favorite film noir movies
what are some of the reasons then man spill it
excuse me
i didn't
even the russian government tried to give them a proper burial which they did in 1991 but they just couldn't find these two bodies
that will bo nice let me no ok
yes you really need to
i have just rewatched the hateful eight twice and am still finding new pieces i absolutely believe are a result of tarantino genius
inglourious basterds i think it's the height of both his dialogue and his characters
plus he runs all over the place
the recent ones for sure
hey what movies have you seen recently
that sounds great
i'm not saying he's not a good guy just not really my type
moana
did you liked it
well that's not an easy are historical research is actually pretty tough
when was ghengis kahn that time
that is a really crazy thing but i bet there are some countries whose children have to fight to survive
it's constant super-graphic violence and sex
great how was yours what did you do
dwayne johnson plays a large part in it and another girl plays this strong female role
yup they really liked baby groot and rocket raccoon
boy i don't know comedy or action
so i'm guessing you didn't like any of the saw films
great
exactly and noone can touch patrick swayze
so is that the cat's name or the man
yeah she did
i love the movie airplane
maybe a movie like the patriot
if this movie return to the theater will you purchase tickets to see it again
was that the tarantino flick
i did go see that one i like the later star trek films like jj abrams'
unfortunately i don't think they have a big part in the new movie
because that would be a terrible thing to do after all they went through to be together
if you had to choose one though
oh i remember those books the movie was so awful
yes it is about robotics
steve buscemi was a great character in that movie i like him
is the new one good
i agree it is hard to watch movies that go way off base of true stories
don't distract me theater of blood madhouse
i wouldn't watch them again if someone paid me
who is in it
no ma i paid last time its your turn this time
yes which one is scary to you
guardians of the galaxy
you could have it in trade for food
and chris pratt steve mcqueen provide a light touch
i don't know why i like some of the things i do at my age i guess it's because age is just a number it always has been
maybe i'll just leave that whole class of movies for you to enjoy
what'd you think about it then
really which movies has she been in
are you talking about the sequel
yeah i actually can handle batman
yes i do the groundhaug day
exactly that show really holds its own
that is not a real war film but sure that was a wonderful movie
no you can handle them you should watch with me one day
sounds good
yeah is that what this is
it is a great story involving mystery
it was good who could forget the balcony shot with everybody in suits
saying iv surprises me as all it does is bank off of the us-russian conflicts in the late 80's
yeah it's pretty bad why don't you include the original rocky
yeah that was a classic
oh cool what you been out doing
yeah i am still here
i hope they dont all end up straight to dvd
no way
what are rat pack movies
you know with the teen actors of the eightees
which gives you what about a hundred thousand
yep and say about half are women so we probably have about 10 thousand actresses vying for jobs in la hollywood area
liam neeson was in star wars too i think
yeah something like 35 on rotten tomatoes
it's my summer vacation now tell me a good movie
that was funny we watched it a little while ago
no i didn't but in the movie it felt like they couldn't create that character right she was too whiny or something
i mean what is the author saying about women
of course i do i have seen many movies of him
yes watch the movie gone girl you be able to stop watching it
you know what will be better
that was a statuesque woman
yeah i think the movie takes place after the civil was of the us had completed so that could have something to do with it
oh yeah me to i would say one of my favorites would have to be 50 first dates
is it very excited to watch
is it still showing now at the movie
the sort of not exactly sequels you mean
it was actual garbage not even fit to watch
that'd be a slap in the face and audiences wouldn't like it
what do you feel like
oh the one with dave chappelle denise richards chris kattanetc
no not yet i've been kind of avoiding it so i don't ruin my childhood
yes that's correct that was kinda awkward suddenly becoming another super hero though he blended very well to captain america it suits him
he is my least favorite character in that movie
what is ait about
yes but i think they love the craft too
i still like it a lot
the one that cusack stole his car
that is what makes it funny
would i like it
right but they were playing against miami or against some team that didn't exist
i completely agree breaking bad was amazing and he did such a great job but i love seeing him doing funny roles as well
that's fair
so have you seen all of his movies
identity
we shall go to the movies
it is the one starring will smith
yes indeed it's hard to see repetitions on will smith movies
you want to come see a flick
well whats better than a sponge driving a krabby patty
it is a classic sleeper
i like the movie too
hey what movies have you seen recently
it's fine you can tell me about them if you'd like
that was blues brothers you moron
you may be a single case though
what do you think about batman v superman dawn of justice
me too
what kind do you like
what is it about
would you be up for watching it with me
their is no such thing as tasteless gore
one of the movies i love is constantine
me too
so are you die hard mission impossible fan
oh the one with the paint it black song
he's the director
which one
yea not a lot of actors were on daytime tv
so he literally owns him that sucks
i haven't seen that one yet it's a coen brothers movie right
of course part of the movie is of that
any hot girls
oh i seen that oneit was a great film
what else has he been in
sound good maybe my sister will like to come too
hmm interesting will need to look it up but would likely be interested who directed it
what do you mean
i can agree
yes but they made a modern movie on 2007 which is hilarious
called over the hedge from 2006
some say vertigo
what were they wearing
i hope they do a good job with this new one
unfortunately
no those are the ones with paul rudd right
yeah i would classify it as such
i guess i would put it in there then
my favorite marvel comic hero character is incredible hulk
i do all the time it never gets bad favorite is let's stay together by al green
excellent and a little upsetting
how was ben affleck
that is understandable
show that will be fine i might have a friend over also
sound good i will keep that in mind
plus i will let you no what time the moves start in the after noon
is there anything you liked about the movies
what do you mean
i'm going to wait a couple days to go see it
that is so interesting
oh that looked funny with this the pigs right
make sure you do
have you seen the latest leonardo dicaprio movie
true let women celebrate a woman superhero
at the beginning before they go into the crappy house didn't they go into the wrong one
yes but not a cartoon
oh so maybe it offended people
i saw beauty and the beast
me too may be we can get together and go together
yes that will be fine and bring some children if you like
and now you can introduce to the plot to a new audience
wow you like a killer that's funny
i don't remember any
what other movies have you seen recently
you did how was that
thanks for the advice have a couple of others in mind
every independent movie has a 90 on rotten tomatoes
is he on drugs or something
about time
to be sure
what character is he
he is one of the evil characters
i got a tough question for you which is your favorite james bond movie
an aging mob boss is under threat of being killed
other mob organizations
finding dory is also a fantastic movie
of course there is
ok then what is tom hanks best performance
have you seen any good movies lately
duh why iii over vi
you remember the gremlins movie
look at all the marvel films in the same vein they always tell a story
they are not as exciting as newer movies
at the movies you can leave the mess to someone else to clean up and fix the sound for you
yes but a neat concept for a movie back then
76 million
no it isn't i do agree though it's a must watch
do you have a theory
it must be from the 30's
i'm still into the survivaloutdoors movies oh and the globalist nwo stuff lately
at any rate i'll keep my ear to the ground and let you know if i hear of anything
what did you think of it did you like it
do you ever watch older movies
i did too it was really good if not silly did you see the second one
that's much better than the new one
yeah i agree i think he kind of representative of the series and its a bummer he is no longer in them
yeah and zac efron
i haven't does it look good
ya there's also also a lot of action and other cool stuff
mine too this is great i love gore
she is totally hot
that's what i heard
it's ok let's better check when it's on the theaters and will go together as we both like these type of movies
when does it come out
i don't think so
i couldn't imagine how much work it would be to create those stunning visual effects
cgi is computer generated image
better than most people i watch
into darkness
i don't care i'm an adult i love disney movies
yeah but what about when you were a kid
bah nonsense of course it is i said i would watch it if it's dubbed
nowhat was it
well it has a lot of actions and good vfx but that's not what made it so cool
yes i saw it on opening night
how do you like them so far
hahaha you truly are scared about everything then
yupi wanted to go to top gun school
it is kind of like a groundhog's day concept he keeps reliving a day
probably horror movies
that makes it even scarier
i know they should've casted another for that role
oh my god yes see it i hadn't seen the other bridget jones's movies but this one had me in tears from laughter
goldeneye was quite good for a laugh too
i saw guardians of the galaxy vol 2 it was awesome
yea better than you probably
i have not seen that one either i know it is similar to romeo and juliet right like the movie
yeah shakespeare in love ever watched it
oh man that was freaking gross i remember watching that as a kid that really turned my stomach
oh my god yes i love molly wringwald shes an awesome actress
why not
can't please everyone i guess
already didn't they just have one come out
that's just a voice role besides he made up for it by being the genie in aladdin
that's a loaded question
it definitely is not many people can make the jump from tv to film
the actor
really no way
that's sane to think
that was a great movie wasn't it
exactly brad pitt really killed it in fight club
and he's genuinely really scary
it was stupid not a hit that was an insult to the comic book
the sound costumes and acting are better than usual but i don't understand why anyone would claim to have enjoyed watching this bipolar fantasy
yes true
or how about the fifth element he played zorg
unfortunately i haven't but i have heard very good reviews
i don't know the blade runner one
why
which one is your favorite
i'm sure they did but not that many i don't think i just think that actual facts can be just as interesting as some things they do for dramatic license
i think it was great
well he always did good in specific roles
yeah it was a pretty good movie
did it seem like the dogs were mistreated
i liked that a lot too do you like vampire and gothic movies
but before him danny elfman did the score for the older batman movies and those were better
girl you have to know which movie it's very popular with the guys it has vin diesel dwayne johnson and jason statham in it
mononoke where the hell did i get hinomoke
the very first film that used the stop motion animation was
we should go on a date and watch it
haha ha that was the first time i fell in love
you know they would not let just anyone do it
i liked going to see the westerns with john wayne in them i liked rooster cogburn the best of them all
do you not like comic films
i look forward to them introducing some more of the dc characters to their cinematic universe
the ticket prices
do you know which movie won
such as
what else did you think kubo offered
i thought it was amazing
it was mediocre not bad not good at all
i even read the book
well i didn't i have heard mixed reviews though
like what name one
did you like the movie signs
did you like the sponge bob movie
not really
do you
i actually thought paranormal activity was real
i agree he does a fine job with it
i did it was funny and had a lot of drama do you like any older dramas
i have no seen many i like gone with the wind
never heard of it like the board game
i agree the casting is a little off from the book character descriptions but elba is a strong actor
who's amy schumer
have you been to the movies lately
about two hours
really out of all the movies she's been in that's your choice
i just think they kind of went to him and bay should have used him again
i dont think thats true
just look at hollywood actresses act like divas all the time
yeah this movie was awesome i loved every minute of it
but surely that's not all there was right
what a great soundtrack on that one loved it
eva green was really good in it too
thats true i guess we wont see it
you dont want to real life characters to come out and speak about how bad the movie is
and jaws is underwater
oh yeah so whats it about
what's your favorite batman movie
hey girl you know wonder woman is playing at the highland theater do you want to go
yeah when they use sudden scary music or a sudden noise or moving object to scare the audience there isn't any creativity involved or real psychological fear and there usually ends up being nothing there anyway
oh i gotcha i know what you mean i just didn't know what they were called
yes he was in maniac
oh yeah that movie was terrifying jack nicholson was fantastic
ill have to agree with you on that
oh wait maybe i'm thinking of a different movie that doesn't sound right how can he destroy all the suits at the end doesn't he wear a suit in spiderman
those are good
ah yeah he's good
i really liked that ritchie rich movie
have you seen the wonderwoman movie
i did
can i go with you
edward norton and matt damon both do a great job in it
which movie
did you hear the new batman is meant to be like the old ones
yes actually recently
yeah
now you thinking about a totally different movie you talking about the one with three brothers and mom that got killed
no rock and it's a cartoon or something
nice are you a fan of scary movies
yea me too
they do have chemistry their characters flirt a lot in the movie
this is different that what you're picturing
how so
no who's in that
did you see all three of the matrix
i get what a runner is uh foley
some of these movies are actually pretty good how about ishtar
yeah it was a bit unbelievable that sequence
remember forrest gump
pretty much that
i loved his mr cellophane number
it was arnold's first film success
well he's just determined that's all he gets beat up pretty bad but he never gives up
i introduced my boyfriend to star wars over the weekend he had never seen them before
have you ever noticed the amount of time travel romance movies
who else plays in it
i know right and how about when cousin harold got shot at the red light
it won best picture in 2000 as well
wait you're changing the choices i want to see an action movie
anne bancroft
the monsters looked huge and pretty cool
i know right she's very far removed from out of sight
phenomenal in dallas buyers club
i thought it was a landmark comedy especially for the time
yeah i would agree with what you said
that is coming close to the amount of fast and furious movies
i thought the brought a nice touch to the series
i don't know i think i seen at least one or two of them
i did
that seems like an odd way to spend what i'm guessing was a low budget would i know anyone in the film
oh yeah that's cool with the special effects being so modern at the time
what movie from your youth had the biggest impact
well i enjoyed it and the story yet
i have to agree with you there it was like they were not sure exactly what they wanted to do with that movie
that's amazing
jimmy stewart was in more than one hitchcock film as i recall
well it's not like you ever had to worry about it living in indiana the worst thing about the beaches on lake michigan are the rip currents that's what kills people every year who go too far out
the movies are always pretty good
samuel l jackson acts in everything
yeah i'd love to hear them
why is that
no but i should
yes
i enjoyed it alot
yes a long time ago why
oh my goodness of course i absolutely love that movie
me too it's crazy it was so long ago
i like fast times
yea that's michael jai white he is a legit fighter
and meg ryan has shorter hair
me too i've wanted a wonder woman movie for a long time and i would have been disappointed if it had sucked
it's jimmy stewart's face it makes me cry too
why isn't jordan pill more of a strictly comedy guy
so you ever seen the movie cemetery man
did you watch the kong movie from the early 2000s
that's really good to hear you always worry slightly when introducing them to something you love yourself
i do james finlayson
what didn't you like about it
that's surprising what happened to it
what other disney movies came out around then
yes it was so sweet
yes
i just refused to watch it because of the hype around it
he watches those all the time so i was trying to think what movies i could buy him that he would like as much as those
that's true sometimes i feel like hollywood is running out of ideas for good movies
i wonder why
she was a good match for russel
me too that one theme song was really good
right i don't always want to pay 15 for a ticket
but what was really fun for me was the way the female director shot this movie
what did you think
i think pixar right
i am not sure who does it have in it
they kind of did i guess there is a good bit of conflict between generations the older people just don't know how to make peace with the new world
well we didn't do that part
me too who was it done by
when i hear it i end up signing it for like 3 days
howie mandel is in the movie
that is funny it was sad at the end though
dolph lundgren plays he-man
me too that era of saturday night live was the best with those players
he was also in that movie multiplicity
there are a lot of great girl group from the 80's like wilson phillipswith that song calledhold on
who is your favorite actor or actress
which one plays joon i'm guessing johnny plays benny
one of the best i've seen in a while
the old one or the newer one
that's not saying much what do you mean
i mean i could enjoy it if i was really bored
yeah it's incredible i love the disney princess movies and this is one of the best for sure
i love boy scouts
60s and 70s but yeah
oh right i guess that makes sense
yes and i hated it
did you see the trailer for the new jumanji movie yet
the one with the rock kevin hart jack black and karen gillan
he works on a carrier
do you have a copy of it
what about your girlfriend has she seen every star wars
yeah
i know
i have the whole weekend off and i am excited
she was and in splash she's a mermaid who falls in love with a human man tom hanks
i like - you had love in the fire swamp and you gave it up
yeah that is beautiful it scared me when i was little
yeah i guess i could see that the witch was pretty spooky
that movie was absolutely fascinating it doesn't sound like i've seen it as many times as you but i enjoyed it
some people say die hard is a christmas movie do you agree
oh the anne hathaway love monologue was a little corny i thought
do you think the humor fits in them
oh how can you not
he often used the same actors in his films
very little i just know that is a comedythrillerdisasterscifi movie
it's always fun to see an actor that you haven't seen in forever
yes i can see what you are getting it
yeah what's that
he did
could you imagine being stuck reliving the same day over
i havent watched that one yet is it good
what did you think of benedict cumberbatch's performance
yep that's what i'm saying
the second one
no not yet
actually john wick is a top assasin that gives up that life for the love of his life
oh yes i do like his movies
i know i thought forever after was great
oh yeah it beat out brokeback mountain
yeah he can be
oh man don't remind me it's painful to think of
yeah and the acting was so dull
i like some of her movies
there was a lot of action in it
exactly they couldnt contain her any other way
but he does not play a cop right he just works for them
which one was that
you talking about the one he directed
true i just remember psychologically the second one was hard to watch
it's just about the apollo 13 space mission and how they all almost died
did you see the reboot of the mummy
yea but that was the whole point it's a thinking movie
it did numbers at the box office but it got the cold-shoulder come award time
time and time again he's proven that it's an art in it of itself
no but i want to
and
i don't know i never saw it
that's the one
i think it was pretty good for its time
i dont balme you for that
i know right
yes he's really the best in it in my opinion
yeah too bad trevor died at the end
yea the one with kris kristoferson and that pretty circus lady
i hate that too that really takes away from a film
was it shot on location somewhere
he is the main reason i want to see the film well that and the music
do you like tyler perry
hairspray discussed some social issues too though it had meaning and depth
the rest dive deeper into the lore of vampire and wolves
buddy he's buddy the elf
no not really not many people are into outer space stuff
i really like marlon wayans but just didn't care for that spoof
she's such an attractive woman
it's depicted like a graphic novel almost like a dark comic book the images seem that way and the characters do too
yeah that's true someone like that wouldn't last in today's pc world
you know what they should make a movie out of thundercats remember that show
it was a really good comedy
yea even though it was for kids i was glued to my seat in the theater
the girlfriend wants to watch the last unicorn and the boyfriend is really pitching steel magnolias
i recall a lot of people didn't really get into it why do you love it
yes will ferrell is hilarious
i liked when they sleepwalking and the poor dad got hurt
yeah there's a few of them
its pretty beautiful how they decided to give it a second chance
that isn't even mel gibson that's the guy who played goose
wow i didn't know that i guess christopher nolan did a great job
incredible now that's dedication and it paid off at the end
no i saw the original cartoon version
i saw it in theaters and i loved it emma watson played a great belle
nice talking to you
yeah everything with eddie murphy is funny though
i know kristen wilson and oliver platt were in it i didn't recognize anyone else
i remember we got an indian toy with the movie
well the luck of the irish is on every march that's my favorite
high school musical
fear is a powerful emotion
he was a little aggressive wasn't he
yes it was
i loved all the feats robert redford did throughout that movie
those are amazing too
no i think he blew up the other guy and shot tarantino
what is your favorite disney movie
and there were novels
yeah they were criminals and thugs to be honest
what are some of your other favorite comedies
it had a few actors
where does it take place
yeah and it's funny too it also has a good moral at the end
but what is it lacking
i know franco is one of you all-time favorites but i thought you hated all rogen films
which are the prequels
awesome thanks for the help i will check those out before we go
i saw the trailer for the new movie coming out pitch perfect 3 i can't wait to see it
it must be like when they did the world championships in pitch perfect 2
okay i didn't see that movie
yeah that sounds like fun do i need to bring anything special
i would say paul newman
it would have been interesting
yes with his brother
where does it take place
the kids group was brat pack
they went to new trier high school
what's your favorite genre of movies
yes it has color even though it was a 1939 movie the color really enhances the feel in the setting
i was impressed they went with the decision to make hiccup lose his leg in the movie
yeah everyone is young again -- scott jean grey charles xavier magneto
it does sound like it would make a fun movie
man you must be joking
guess what i went and saw last night
the cameos in that film alone earned it a high score to me
that sounds great my girls have been asking to see it too it looks so cute
my son keeps making fun of the arnold schwarzenegger reference with the cookie
i sure am being a teacher can be very draining
so did i
have you seen the movie moana
isn't she a singer
yes you need to watch it
the second movie introduces puss in boots to the ensemble which does a good job of shaking up the hero foil romantic interest triangle and allows more nuanced character interactions
the way the first one ended was awesome
no but i've heard it's good is it worth watching
is it about superheros
of course everything is on netflix
especially since it has one of my favorite actors
omg i love that movie
well nothing really happens
they find some vault and the ghost kills them
i think it just came on netflix so it should be there a while
yeah and then when they have django strung up upside down
i don't think it's the type of movie you could ever see too many times plus there's a great duet with steve carrell and dane cook doing let my love open the door
at first he sees giant cockroaches and typewriters turning into cockroaches
yeah and it gets even weirder
yes lets go see that one
yeah it was entertaining not the best scarlett's been in better movies like her woody allen movies
yea the storyline was cute and the music was really good
i really like harry but ron cracks me up
i did last night
it was really good i'd give it a 55 stars
did you like the story
you should try donnie darko or mulholland drive
that's because humans are dangerous to everything ultron was right
yes actually all three of them chris pine kevin durand and maury sterling were unbelieveable stole the show
yes and those are all sad scenarios but one critic compared it to- what we see is it is all a crock people moving human situations around like pieces on a chessboard
ugh me too especially superhero movies
yeah it's been awhile since i saw it who was in it
when does the new spiderman movie come out
if i'm counting horror movies i have to say the hills have eyes two that movie was just great
that wasn't a bad one i actually really enjoyed all of the saw movies
i like it for a couple of reasons first the music
i also laughed so hard at miss scarleti think we all walked around saying well communism is only a red herring
oh really
do you ever watch anime movies
that's ok i guess
me too
yea i love those minions
the fast and furious that was just released is number 9 the fate of the furious
oh wait a second maybe i have seen it was that the one with the fake giant goose
i guess but i feel like most movies kind of are
jeff goldblum
jeff goldblum is famous for so many lines from that movie
his real name is javier bardem
i heard the movie had done really good at the box office
the scene where big red was dangling dude over the balcony
that would be a great movie
well yeah because it's essentially moving thousands of people from planet to another
cocktails was another good one
i don't know but it's a rip off
the best
that is very true
i recently heard that with digital recording lens flare doesn't even happen anymore and it's all added in afterwards
like what
yup any other good ones
how about the justice league this one might be interesting
funny thing is the sequels got progressively funny
i know and basically ends where evil dead 3 begins
yeah he's pretty good i wonder who they will get to play him next
